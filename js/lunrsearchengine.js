This page is intended to be a list of Jack Daniel’s bottles and memorabilia that I am actively searching for, as well as a list of things I might have available for trading. This is not an all inclusive list, I am definitely looking for more than this, so if you’ve got something you’re interested in parting with, let me know. Will you sell any bottles?: I am not super interested in selling the items I have for trade, the goal is to acquire more for my collection, not decrease the size of my collection with selling at this time. There are also lots of potential legal issues with selling liquor that I simply don’t want to have to worry about. Where will you trade?: I prefer trades in the Mid-West. I am near St. Louis, and willing to drive/meet typically within a 5 hour driving radius if needed. If you’re outside that 5 hours radius, that’s okay, don’t hesitate to reach out. I travel for work some times and might be able to meet you elsewhere.

    "body": "The Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Tasters’ Series is a special line of limited-edition whiskeys from the iconic Jack Daniel’s Distillery. This series is designed to offer whiskey enthusiasts unique and innovative whiskey selections. Each release in the series is selected by Jack Daniel’s Master Tasters and showcases different methods of crafting whiskey, including varied grains, barrels, and maturation processes. The series includes small-batch versions of experimental whiskeys, often available only at the distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee, or in select markets. Examples from the series include whiskeys with high angel’s share barrels, experimental rye recipes, and unique finishing methods like hickory staves or maple barrels. Each bottle typically features details about the whiskey’s creation process, along with the signature of the taster who selected it, making them highly collectible for fans of the brand. The Tasters’ series ended with the #7 release, 14E19 ‘Twin’ Blend Whiskey, and was then replaced with the Distillery Series which currently has 4 releases with a 6th originally scheduled for April 2024. Both of these series have been released in simple 375ml bottles.

I won’t get into all the details about the truck itself, you can follow them on social media for more about that. Here’s some of the press release about the High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey  Antheum Spirits and Tennessee Legend Distillery are excited to unveil High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey, a spirit that pays homage to the storied High Roller Monster Truck, which has been a symbol of adventure and resilience since 1985.

    "title": "Family ties to bootlegging during prohibition",
    "body": "2024/05/13 - As we get older, we get more nostalgic. As both my parents have aged, my brother and I have spent time going through things they have kept/collected throughout the years. In doing so, you come across all sorts of interesting things, I feel like the older you get, the more interesting some of those things become. One thing I came across a few years ago, and flagged for future research, was a newspaper clipping. Actually it was more than a clipping, it was the entire front page of the May 13th, 1924 Sedalia Capital. The headline at the top of the newspaper read  AGENTS FIND BIG STILL I saw this and wondered why would my father have this paper, it was from 21 years before his birth. The 1920s were deep in the prohibition era, and if you spend any time researching that time period you’ll find almost daily mentions in the papers about violations of prohibition. Being that this article was published 100 years ago today, I figured it was a good time to put a blog post together about it. When Dad passed last year, I spent some time in Sedalia for his funeral and also for my uncle and great aunt’s funerals. In doing so, I was able to spend some time walking around a couple of cemeteries and looking at the various names. One of those names was Butterbaugh. The article mentions the Still was found in a raid of the E. H. Butterbaugh farm, north of Sedalia. The Hammond and Butterbaugh families have a lot of space consumed at the Hopewell Cemetary north of Sedalia. I’ve spent some time over the past couple of years dabling with ancestry. com, trying to see how far the family tree stretches, earlier this year I went down the rabbit hole of tracking down who E. H. Butterbaugh was, and how we are connected. Before I get into the family specifics, let’s take a look at a couple of the articles I’ve been able to dig up relating to this corn whiskey still. Besides the Sedalia Democrat front page, I was able to use NewspaperArchives. com to track down a number of reports and details about the raid with a variety of articles that reported on it through the years. Here’s the text of the article from the Sedalia Democrat from May 13, 1924 (image of article transcribed by ChatGPT, I’ve tried to ensure correctness but it’s possible it missed some words, original paper clipping attached to the gallery) IMMENSE STILL SEIZED IN RAID LATE MONDAY:  Found Concealed Beneath Barn on Farm of E. W. Butterbaugh.  What is declared to be the largest still ever sized in Pettis county was found late Monday afternoon by Sheriff W. H. Fewell, Deputy Sheriff Landon Welch and two federal officers working under Chief General Prohibition Agent W. D. Moss, of Kansas City. In an underground room on the farm of E. W. Butterbaugh, eight miles northeast of Sedalia. The officers were acting under a search warrant issued by United States Commissioner W. E. Miller.  Butterbaugh was taken in custody, brought to Sedalia and appeared before Commissioner Miller, where he furnished bond of $1000 signed by J. W. Roach, for his appearance at a preliminary hearing before Commissioner Miller, at 2 o’clock Saturday afternoon, May 17.  So carefully concealed was the still that although the officers had received tips, stating that it was underneath the barn, they searched the place for two hours before they finally came upon a trap door under the manger, covered with hay, which led down steps into a concealed room, where the fifty gallon capacity copper still was found. He was brought to the county jail by the officers.  This room, the officers stated, was 12 by 15 feet, well ventilated, and lighted by a lamp. The farm had been searched about a half dozen times before, but although the officers had received their information very straight, they were unable to locate the hiding place.  Nearly 300 gallons of mash was found, but no corn whisky. The officers did find about a gallon and a half of corn whisky in jugs across the road from the Butterbaugh place, but were unable to find to whom it belonged, or by whom it had been placed there.  According to the officers, they tapped the telephone wire leading into the home, and overheard a conversation in which some one “tipped” Butterbaugh to the fact that the raid was going to be made. “This is Fred” the voice is said to have informed Mrs. Butterbaugh, and told her to get her husband, and get him quick. Later, the officers stated, a car left the Butterbaugh place, going south, and returned in about twenty minutes.  Butterbaugh later admitted to the officers that he had removed the coil from the still, and had thrown it into the creek.  The officers also arrested three negroes, during the afternoon, Melvin Jones, charged with selling four and one half pints of corn whisky for $1 per half pint; Oscar Bell, charged with possessing and selling corn whisky, and Babe Bell, also charged with possessing and selling whisky. All were released on bond and bound over to the action of the federal court, which convenes in Jefferson City in October. The bonds of Oscar and Babe Bell, for $500 each were signed by their mother, Mary Preston, while Jones’ bond was signed by his brother-in-law, A. T. Jackman.  The federal officers stated this afternoon that they had been given splendid support in their work in Pettis County by Sheriff W. H. Fewell and his deputies. How am I connected to E. W. Butterbaugh? Well, through a lot of digging and family tree research I have determined that Edward William Butterbaugh was the step grandson of my 3rd Great Aunt on my father’s side. Kicker, he’s also the Stepson of my 1st Cousin 4x removed…. Here’s a more detailed breakdown. : My 4th Great Grandfather on my Dad’s side was Anson Hammond (1821-1864). Anson was married to Margaretta A. Witty Hammond (1825-1891), they had 8 children. My 3rd Great Grandfather was their second eldest, Barzillia Hammond. Their youngest Daughter was Susan E. Hammond (1858-1939). Susan E. Hammond originally married Benjamin Ditton in 1874, they had I believe two children Wilbur and Ruth Ditton.  (In finalizing this article I came across a third child, listed below. ) I believe Benjamin Ditton passed and Susan remarried in August 1890 to David Butterbaugh. David and Susan had 2 children between them, Margaret Jane “Maggie” Butterbaugh (1891-1969) and Golda “Goldie” Hazel Butterbaugh (1893-1981). David had 7 children prior to marrying Susan. One of those children was William B. Butterbaugh (1864-1952), Edward W. Butterbaugh’s (1891-1965) father. E. W. ’s mother was Elizabeth Edwards (1876-1891). Now here’s the twist. E. W. ’s father William, after Elizabeth’s passing, married Edith M Belle Ditton (1876-1911), who I believe to be Susan E. Hammond and Benjamin Ditton’s daughter. So, E. W. ’s grandfather was married to his step mom’s mother (step grandmother). Butterbaugh Prohibition Issues: In doing research for this article, I came across multiple short blurbs in newspapers about the Butterbaugh family having run ins with the law during prohibition. I wish I had a connection to a recipe or something from back then, would be cool to start a Butterbaugh Whiskey business based on family history! I’ve included a number of different incidents and paper mentions in the gallery here. Hammond Family History: Stay tuned for another Hammond family history post next month as I get into the topic of Mattie Corrine Hammond! I’ll post that over on HorsesAndCars. com as it doesn’t have a whiskey tie into it (that I’ve found). Here’s another Hammond Family history article that is actually a transcription from something that Susan E. Hammond wrote before she passed. "

    "body": "2023/11/22 - Jack Daniel’s ventured into Rye over 10 years ago and has regularly been adding to their line since. In 2023 Jack Daniel’s started bottling and releasing their Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye, to go along with their Single Barrel Barrel Proof Tennessee Whiskey. This will be regular release going forward. On the initial release it has been difficult to find on the shelves, but in the past couple of years, Single Barrel Barrel Proof Tennesse Whiskey has been hard to come by as well. The barrel is the typical Jack Daniel’s single barrel bottle, with the gold label that you should be familiar with. The print on the labels are in green, versus the usual black for the normal barrel proof. The neck contains a green label with the barrel number, bottling date, and the knob on the cork is the usual black with the Jack Daniel’s logo on it. The bottom label on the front reads RYE and has a green background where the proof and volume are listed. I wish I paid retail for my first bottle, but I didn’t. I found this bottle in Nashville, TN in June 2023. I paid about 2x retail, but it was the first one I had found, and was a very high proof at 139. 3. Have you found a bottle of the Barrel Proof Rye yet? Keep looking, it should be available pretty much anywhere you can find the Barrel Proof Tennessee Whiskey!

You shouldn’t really be paying more than retail for this bottle as it is a regular release. Higher proofs might draw a little more value, but not too much. Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment: A great bottle to own, go for the higher proofs you can find, or bottls with specific bottling dates that are important to you. "

    "title": "Jack Daniel's life story, according to ChatGPT",
    "body": "2023/03/06 - Over the past few months I’ve been playing with ChatGPT. I figured I should give it a shot at writing the life story of Jack Daniel’s. I’m not sure if it’s 100% accurate, but it certainly hits most of the points. Prompt: What’s the life story of Jack Daniel? Be sure to include information Nearest Green. Response: Jack Daniel was an American distiller and businessman who founded the Jack Daniel’s Tennessee whiskey distillery. His life story is one of perseverance, ingenuity, and hard work, and it is also deeply connected to the story of Nearest Green, an African American distiller who played a significant role in the development of the Jack Daniel’s brand. Jack Daniel was born in 1850 in Lynchburg, Tennessee. His exact birthdate is unknown as birth records were not kept in his area at the time. He was the youngest of ten children, and his parents were of Scottish and Irish descent. His father died when he was young, and he grew up working on his family’s farm. When he was 13, Jack ran away from home and was taken in by a local preacher, Dan Call. Call owned a distillery and taught Jack the art of making whiskey. After a few years, Jack left to start his own distillery with his mentor’s help. They called their operation “Call and Daniel’s,” and it quickly became successful. In 1884, Jack bought out his partner and renamed the distillery “Jack Daniel’s. ” He perfected his recipe for Tennessee whiskey, using a unique charcoal mellowing process that gave the whiskey a smoother flavor. His whiskey became famous, and he won numerous awards for its quality. However, for many years, the role that Nearest Green played in the development of the Jack Daniel’s brand was largely unknown. Green was a slave on a farm owned by Dan Call, and he was also a skilled distiller. It is believed that Green taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey using the charcoal mellowing process, which became a defining characteristic of the Jack Daniel’s brand. After the Civil War, Green continued to work for Call as a free man and was eventually hired by Jack Daniel as the distillery’s first head distiller. Green taught his techniques to other workers at the distillery, and his legacy lived on long after his death. Today, many people see Green as an important figure in the history of American whiskey and an example of the resilience and ingenuity of the African American community. In recent years, the Jack Daniel’s distillery has taken steps to honor Green’s legacy, including unveiling a memorial to him in 2016 and establishing the Nearest Green Foundation to promote diversity in the whiskey industry. Jack Daniel’s whiskey remains one of the most popular whiskey brands in the world, with its distinctive black and white label recognized across the globe. The distillery still operates in Lynchburg, Tennessee, and attracts visitors from around the world who want to learn more about the history of this iconic brand and the important role that Nearest Green played in its development.

    "title": "How Much Is My Jack Daniels Collection Worth?",
    "body": "2022/12/20 - We get asked this question a lot.  “How much is my Jack Daniels collection worth?” The answer is, it depends.  There are a lot of factors that go into determining the value of a collection.  We will try to cover some things, but likely not all, that go into evaluating a liquor collection. What are you collecting?: Are you collecting just Jack Daniel’s, or do you collect other bourbons and whiskeys as well? What you focus on collecting will be important. Do you have lots of non-bottle items in your collection? I have a few things, a couple of barrels, a yard stick, a bat, and a variety of smaller items, couple of signs, but the majority of my collection is (and almost always will be) bottles. How long have you been collecting? Many Jack Daniel’s collections have been put together over decades. I personally have been collecting since around 1998, though early on I wasn’t necessarily collecting, I managed to save a lot of things over the years. How much do you think you have invested in your collection? Seriously, think about how much you’ve spent over the years. I can guess what I’ve spent over the years, though with my inventory sheet I have a pretty good idea of what I’ve spent in the last 12-24 months. Going forward, keep track of your purchases (see inventory below). Condition: What condition are your bottles in? Is the glass clean? Have they been regularly dusted? If you haven’t dusted them lately, do they clean up when you do dust them? You can often times clean them with a solution, but be careful not to damage labels, tax stamps, or seals. Are the labels intact? Have they been damaged? Are they faded? Do they have any rips or tears in the label? Is the label crooked? Does the label have any stains? All of these things can impact the value of a bottle. Are the bottles full? If they are unopened, and full, they are worth more. If the bottle has been opened, than you can’t prove the contents are legitimate, there are definitely people out there who fake bottles. Is there any leakage? If the bottle has leaked, the value of the bottle might be reduced, but this can actually be fairly common for older bottles and might have little impact on the value. Do the corks look good? Are they in good shape? Have you regularly rotated the bottles so that the corks don’t dry out? If they dry out, they can fall apart and fall into the bottle.  This can decrease the value of the bottle and the contents. Are the seals intact? If the seals have been tampered with, the value of the bottle can be greatly reduced. Is there a tax stamp? Older bottles oftentimes have tax stamps, they can actually allow you to get a date for the bottle. Newer bottles don’t have tax stamps, so you have to look at other things to try to determine age. Are there any chips or cracks in the bottles? If so, the value will be impacted. Age: How old are the bottles? Do you know how to tell? Sometimes you can figure out the age based on a tax stamp, some times you can figure out the age based on a marking on the bottle? Often times with Jack Daniel’s bottles there is a number on the bottom of the bottle to determine the year. With JD Single Barrel products you can determine when it was bottled based on the label around the neck. Are they from a limited release? Jack Daniel’s has been doing special bottles and releases for decades. Rarity: How many bottles were produced? That will completely vary based on the release, each release is definitely different, and sometimes, for example the Eric Church bottles there were actually multiple releases over the years. Where can I sell my collection?: That one can be a tricky question to answer, there are a lot of factors to consider. Where do you live? Do you know what the laws are around selling alcohol in your state?Are you able to ship them? Legally? Shipping of alcohol via USPS, Fedex and UPS is pretty restricted based on laws. Do you want to sell them all at once or one at a time?Do you want to sell them to a private collector or a retailer? If you are in our around St. Louis (5-6 hour radius) and interested in selling, be sure to reach out to me. I might be interested. "

Jack Daniel’s Distillery Series Toasted Barrel Finished Rye Jack Daniel’s Distillery Series Toasted Maple BarrelInformation about them from Jack Daniel’s social media:  A few years ago we began a special line of experimental whiskeys available only in Tennessee now called our Jack Daniel’s Distillery Series to give us an opportunity to celebrate, and share some of the special whiskeys that we’ve crafted. This October our eighth and ninth selections will be available – Jack Daniel’s Toasted Maple Barrel Rye and Toasted Barrel Finished Rye.  Jack Daniel’s Assistant Distiller Lexie Phillips has teamed up with her husband, Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Processing Operator and taster Josh Phillips to create two new offerings that truly stand out and reflect Jack Daniel’s spirit of craft and innovation.  Jack Daniel’s Distillery Series Toasted Barrel Finished Rye was selected by Lexie Phillips and is a Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey bottled at 101 proof (50. 5% abv) with notes of caramel and toasted oak with layers of rye spice, molasses, and dark chocolate imparting a full body mouth feel.

Back in 2021 when we were bottling our Single Barrel Special Release Coy Hill High Proof, we found around 55 barrels where the Angel’s Share was so high the liquid inside could not be bottled as Single Barrel selections. When we found these barrels in our Coy Hill barrelhouses, we immediately knew we had something special.  Jack Daniel’s Small Batch Special Release Coy Hill High Proof has an aroma of burnt sugar, cooked fruit, and oak with notes of rich molasses and concentrated barrel spice with bold oak. It finishes long and full with layers of char, dried fruit, and caramel. Matured in the highest reaches of barrelhouses on Coy Hill, the highest elevation at the Jack Daniel Distillery, this Tennessee Whiskey is bottled at proof points ranging from 143. 6 - 155. 1. It is the highest proof whiskey that we’ve released to date.  The 375 ml bottles will be available in very limited quantities in Tennessee and at the White Rabbit Bottle Shop at the Jack Daniel Distillery with a suggested retail price of $55. The White Rabbit Bottle Shop will begin sales on Friday, July 1 at 8:00 a. m. There will be a limit of one bottle per visitor.

The word on these releases is that they will be available regularly going forward, and are not limited releases like the 10 Year and Heritage barrels released over the last few years (more of those coming however). The first bottle we covered was Jack Daniel’s Bottled-In-Bond Tennessee Whiskey. The second bottle is Jack Daniel’s Triple Mash Blended Straight Whiskey. This release is also Bottled in Bond, which means it was distilled in one season, aged a minimum of 4 years in a government bonded warehouse, with no removal or addition of materials besides water for proofing and it must also be bottled at 100 proof. From the Jack Daniel’s Website:  Jack Daniel’s Triple Mash is a Bottled-in-Bond whiskey, which must be distilled by a single distiller during a single distillation season, matured in a government bonded warehouse for at least four years, and bottled at 100 proof.  Barrels are hand-selected for their characteristics of deeper color, flavor, and aroma, which deliver a darker, richer, and more oak-forward character.

    "body": "2022/05/25 - For 2022 Jack Daniel’s announced, and released, two new expressions. Both of these are released in a 700ml (and also a 1L version). The word on these releases is that they will be available regularly going forward, and are not limited releases like the 10 Year and Heritage barrels released over the last few years (more of those coming however). The first bottle we’ll cover is the new Jack Daniel’s Bonded Tennessee Whiskey. The release is in a bottle styled after early Jack Daniel’s bottles, with raised letters in the bottles which we’ll document below. The labels are minimal, creating a beautiful bottle that will look great in your collection. This release is Bottled in Bond, which means it was distilled in one season, aged a minimum of 4 years in a government bonded warehouse, with no removal or addition of materials besides water for proofing and it must also be bottled at 100 proof. From the Jack Daniel’s Website:  Jack Daniel’s Bonded is a Bottled-in-Bond whiskey, which must be distilled by a single distiller during a single distillation season, matured in a government bonded warehouse for at least four years, and bottled at 100 proof.  Barrels are hand-selected for their characteristics of deeper color, flavor, and aroma, which deliver a darker, richer, and more oak-forward character. It’s a big, bold Tennessee Whiskey at 100 proof with layered notes of caramel, rich oak, and spice giving way to a pleasantly lingering finish. The front of the bottle reads:  Neck Label: 100 ProofLabel: Jack Daniel’s Bonded Tennessee WhiskeyAged in select barrels for added depth and characterBottled-in-bond - 100 ProofMade in Tennessee / Bottled At The DistilleryBottle: Jack Daniel Distillery DSP-TN-1 Tennessee The side labels read:  Right Side: Distilled and bottled by Jack Daniel Distillery Lynchburg, Tenn.

Since then I have found it in St. Louis as well. It will be interesting to see how long these stays in stock, and how frequently the shelves are restocked. At the $35 price point, it should be very interesting in the whiskey/bourbon space! Release: 2022Proof: 100Size: 700mlPrice: $34. 99 "

    "body": "2022/03/24 - For the past 6 or 9 months, there has been a Jack Daniel’s Facebook Group Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey that has been controlled at first by someone in Vietnam, and then someone in another part of Asia, that has simply put, been over run by scammers and frauds. Upwards of 50 times a day, there would be posts, mostly from accounts outside of the United States (that’s not to say there are not Jack Daniel’s fans all around the world) that were basically trying to scam people into paying for T-Shirts that would never get sent, or scam them to pay for bottles of various whiskeys and other things that would never actually ship. Spam, spam, spam. Lots of it. No matter how much you reported the group to Facebook, or how much you reported the group to the Admin(s) it wouldn’t stop. Well, I have put a stop to it. (At least I am attempting to). I have managed to talk my way into becoming the sole admin of the group, and I’ve spent quite a bit of time over the last 24 hours cleaning it up. Deleting posts, blocking authors, removing comments, setting up automated rules, to try to prevent additional spam from infiltrating the group. There are currently 21k members in the group. How many of those are fraudulent accounts? I can’t say for sure. But I can tell you, there are real accounts in there, and they love Jack Daniel’s, and they love sharing, discussing, and commenting on posts. We will clean this up. We will make it better. If you’re on Facebook, come on over and check the group out. While I am the sole admin right now, I have no visions of trying to maintain a firm grasp that only I control. I will be working on setting up additional moderators and such in the group to help keep it clean, useful, and fun. If you’re looking for a place to buy/sell whiskey, this is not the group for you. This is a place to talk about Jack Daniel’s and other Tennessee Whiskey, so grab a drink, have a seat, and stay for a while. Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey "

On previous trips to Lynchburg Tennessee I had tried to stop at the Uncle Nearest Distillery in Shelbyville, but the first time I stopped they were still under construction. The second time I stopped was their opening weekend, but it was still closed for a Green family event. Finally on March 4th of 2022 I was able to make a quick stop into the distillery. The property looks amazing, I unfortunately didn’t get time to tour any of the facility, we just popped in to check out the shop on our rushed way back to Nashville after a visit to Lynchburg earlier in the morning. At the bottle shop I was able to pick up a bottle of the Uncle Nearest Master Blend Edition, a limited edition only available at the distillery. I have yet to open the bottle, but plan to do so at a future tasting that I will be organizing. The bottle comes in the standard Nearest Green bottle shape, the same as 1820, 1856 and 1884. The label however differs as there is no Number (year) to this bottle. The label is primarily a white/vanilla with maroon and gold text. The sides of the label are purple wrapping around the sides of the bottle. Here are some of the details for the labels. The front label reads:  Nearest Green Distillery Shelbyville, TNUncle NearestMaster Blend Edition Premium Whiskey“In every small batch I blend, there are a few barrels that really stand out.

While the previous Special Release bottles from Jack Daniel’s have been hard to find, this one saw demand like no other. Secondary prices for the bottle appear to be almost 10x retail. I hate to tell you what I paid for mine, not that much, but not much better. The bottle comes in the familiar single barrel shape, with red labels with gold accents. The neck is unique in that on this bottle they also tell you the “barrel entry” date in addition to the bottling date. This is not something I’ve seen on previous Jack Daniel’s bottles. It is a beautiful bottle, and if you can get your hands on one, I highly recommend you do. I am currently still on the hunt for another bottle or two so that I can open one up and have a drink!

It didn’t hit stores in the eastern half of Missouri until February 2022, and was sold out quickly. I was able to get two bottles ordered online this fall, and have them in my collection for now, though I have yet to open one, hoping I can find a third bottle.

From the Tennessee Squire Association website::  Membership in the Squire Association is a reward for our loyal friends of Jack Daniel’s. Squires are nominated (most often by other Squires) and are welcomed into the Association with a letter, a membership card, and an unrecorded deed to their own small “piece of property,” which is given a unique plot number. Our criteria for becoming a member of the Squire Association is that a person be a loyal friend of Jack Daniel’s who is also a generous, responsible person of character and not associated with the beverage alcohol industry in any way. A nominee must also be of legal drinking age in their country of residence. A big thank you to Steve for my nomination! "

    "title": "Jack Daniel's Visit June 2021",
    "body": "2021/06/19 - This week I got out on my first work trip, since probably August 2019. I started a new job last year, about a week after the world shut down for the pandemic, so work trips have been on hold for quite some time, that and the last employer stopped my travelling, so I hadn’t been on the road for work in quite some time. It was great to get out and meet some fellow employees and customers face to face. Fortunately for me the trip was to Franklin, TN, which isn’t too far from Lynchburg, so I turned the work trip into a little fun too. Before heading down, I signed up for the Angel’s Share tour on Thursday morning. Wednesday after the work meetings were over I drove around Franklin TN a bit and did some whiskey hunting, checking out the local liquor stores to see what I could find. I ended up picking up a bottle of Wheeler’s Raid, which is a local whiskey out of Nolensville, TN I believe, on the recommendation of a coworker. I also managed to find a bottle of the Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Tasters’ Series High Angel’s Share sitting on a shelf. I jumped at the opportunity to buy it, I wish I had a picture of the receipt, I honestly can’t recall what I paid for it, it was either $42 or $65. Either way, the High Angel’s Share Tasters’ is one of the hardest to find, and I found it to be an excellent drinker, so picking up another one was worth the price. I did stumble on another bottle of it at Celebration Liquors in Lynchburg later, but they wanted $150 for it. After hunting around a few stores I met up with a lady named Debbie who I had been speaking with on Facebook for over 6 months. She had reached out late last year when I had posted on a thread that I had a 2019 Holiday Calendar that I would be willing to sell/trade. I told her I would hold on to it for her, and when I made a trip out to TN (originally planned to go in December) I would bring it for her. Earlier this year I reached out and asked her to try to find me the latest two Tennessee Tasters’ bottles, the Jamaican Allspice and the 14E19 “Twin” Blend | Whiskey. The Jamaican Allspice bottle was one I was pretty sure that I could find, but the Twin blend was going to be harder, as it was rumored to be a much smaller release Debbie came through, we met at a gas station and exchanged prizes had a nice chat about all things Jack Daniel’s while there. I mentioned that I had picked up the Angel’s Share bottle and told her that I thought there was one more there if she wanted it, I really hope she was able to get it! From there I headed south towards Lynchburg, I had grand visions of trying to be down there around Sunset to get some photos, unfortunately those visions weren’t quite met though I did get some decent shots you can see below. I got down there a little later than I had hoped, and being down in the valley/hollow sunset is kinda hard to grasp due to all the shade from the hills and trees. I did spend quite a bit of time driving around the hills of Lynchburg getting to see some areas I’ve never seen before. I came across one field of vegetables that had a large group of menonite women/girls sitting in a circle. It really would have made the coolest picture, but I didn’t want to be the creepy guy taking photos of them in a field so I just kept driving by. As I was passing through a small town of Petersburg, TN I stopped to take a photo or two of the town square. I talked to a local artist who was out walking his 8 month old shepard/lab mix Skippy. We talked for a while, he does patriotic veteran based art that is used I believe in VA hospitals to cheer up the vets. He apparently he only moved there a few months ago, but he was very approving of the town. A car pulled up and said hello to Skippy, small town, everyone knows everyone, including the dogs. They asked me if I was going to move there. Pushy people these Petersburgians. Wednesday morning I once again had visions of getting up super early and trying to see if I could find any cool places for sunrise shots around Lynchburg. Before finally turning out the lights near midnight I decided that simply wasn’t going to happen and I set my alarm for a more realistic 630am. I got up and hit the road, mostly going against traffic down to Lynchburg and arrived around 815am. The visitor’s center didn’t open until close to 9am so I wandered around the front with my camera looking for some more shots. The doors opened shortly before 9am and everyone started getting checked in for their tour tickets. I made a quick pass through the White Rabbit Bottle Shop to see what they had, so I could make sure I was “ready” after the tour to pickup what I needed. The tour had 17 folks on it, we took a shuttle up to the “starting” point and were informed that some of the tour had been modified due to Covid, as well as due to an event that was occuring later that day. We would not be going into the barrel house and doing our tasting there as normal, we would be doing our tasting in Bethel Church instead, an apparently rare event. The tour was great as usual, though we didn’t get to go into the distillation area and also didn’t get to go through the bottling area :(. One day I hope to get to walk around the distillery with an employee who can get me into areas tours don’t normally go. We started the tour near the rickyard where they make the charcoal used for mellowing the Tennessee Whiskey. They were making charcoal at the time, which is always a cool experience to see.  For the finish of the Angel’s Share tour you are supposed to get a taste of Gold 27, Sinatra Select, Single Barrel Select, Single Barrel Barrel Proof and Single Barrel Rye. We were informed that they were “out” of the Gold 27, so they were giving us Gentleman Jack instead.  From the tasting we did get taken into the barrel house that was part of the ceremony later in the day, but only into the barrel storage area, not into the tasting area for a quick introduction to some of the barrels there. Our tour guide told us they were all “green” barrels, everyone assumed that meant Green Label, but later in the day that barrel house was renamed to be The George Green Barrel House, so I wonder if there as more to that. After the tour I paid my visit to the White Rabbit again, this time picking up 3 more Tennessee Tasters’ bottles. Two of the “Twin” and one of the Allspice, rounding out 3 of each of those. One for drinking, one for collecting and one for trading in the future. I also paid to have my rocks glass that I received from the tour engraved with the date and type of tour, to put on display in the collection. Next up for me was a visit to the Squire house, the old Motlow house on the property there at the distillery. The Tennessee Squire Association is in its 65th year, having been founded in 1956. I became a squire last year like a week after my dad and I visited the distillery, so this was my first trip as a squire. I got to meet and shake hands with Randall Fanning, and sit and chat with him for a while there in the house. I picked up some Squire specific merchandise and got a copy of Chasing Whiskey signed by Randall and then decided to hit the road back home to St. Louis. On the way home I made a quick stop by the Nearest Green Distillery to see if I could talk my way into anything there, they had/have their grand opening today (6/19). The place was packed with cars, and workers everywhere, so I pulled into the lot, to a quick photo (below) and then got back on the road. I did make one last liquor store stop at Liquor Planet in Murfreesboro. I had stopped there a couple of times previously, one of the St Louis Bourbon Society Admins has posted a photo from there the prior day with a particular Jack Daniel’s Single barrel that I wanted, so I stopped in to pick it up. It was just a store pick, but it has a picture of Randall Fanning and Goose, along with one other person (Will perhaps?) applied via a decal, I wanted to add that to my collection so I picked one up. The rest of the trip was uneventful, which is always nice. Until the next trip, this one will hold me over. "

    "body": "2021/03/19 - The Jack Daniel’s Scenes from Lynchburg Series is a collection of 8 bottles, released every year from 2003 to 2011 (skipping 2010). Each bottle features a picture on the front depicting a scene from Lynchburg, Tennessee, the home of the Jack Daniel’s Distillery. I have/had a few bottles from the series that I picked up at the Distillery on a couple of different trips. I ended up trading one of the bottles in 2020 for the Before and After set from the distillery, but I took pictures of it before trading and will post about it later. The first bottle I picked up was Scenes From Lynchburg Number Five, released in 2007. The front of the bottle features a picture of the Jack Daniel statue at the cave spring in Lynchburg. The current statue was put in place in 2000 and can be found all over social media as people post for pictures next to Jack. The front of the bottle reads::  Jack Daniel’sOld No. 7 BrandJack Daniel Tennessee Whiskey The neck label reads::  Jack Daniel Scenes From Lynchburg The back of the bottle reads:  Jack Daniel’sScenes from Lynchburg Number FiveThis is the fifth in a series of bottles depicting life in Lynchburg, Tennessee, home of the Jack Daniel Distillery. When it came to making this Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel was rock-solid in his determination to make it the best he could. This 600-pound bronze statue of Mr. Jack is a reminder of his commitment. Sculpted by an artist from Nashville, it has been standing guard in front of the distillery’s cave spring since September 2000, which happens to have been Mr. Jack’s 150th birthday. It replaced the original marple statue that stood there for nearly 60 years, which is now located inside the Distillery’s Visitor Center. The sides of this bottle are blank, with no label or printing on either side of the side of the neck. Finding this bottle online isn’t easy, I found it online in one location for nearly $1,000. In the United States the bottle was released as a 750ml bottle at 86 proof. In Europe I believe there was a 1 liter version, and in Canada it was proofed at 80.

For some reason I never got around to posting about it though, even though I took the pictures for it back in 2019!

    "body": "2021/02/14 - In getting ready for this post I realized this is the first time I’ve actually blogged about Blackened. I’ve had a few bottles over the past couple of years, and will document some of those later on, but for now, here’s batch 106. Blackened American Whiskey is a collaboration of whiskey between Metallica and the late Dave Pickerell. The premise is that the whiskey is finished in black brandy casks and blasted with low frequency sound waves of Metallica’s music. Batch 106 is special because it is the S&amp;M 2 release, marking the release of Metallica’s S&amp;M Concert with the San Francisco Symphony. The whiskey was finished with the music from that event, originally recorded in September 2019. The post covers the release of Batch 106 with a black box and artwork on the box. It didn’t come with the S&amp;M 2 vinyl, but I had already ordered that separate from Metallica. The front of the box reads::  Limited Edition S&amp;M2BlackenedA Blend Of Straight Whiskeys Finished in Black Brandy CasksRe-mastered by Dave Pickerell750 ML45% ALC/VOL(90 Proof) The sides of the box don’t have any dedicated text on them. The back of the box reads::  S&amp;M2 Blackened American WhiskeyMetallica and San Francisco Symphony’s S&amp;M2 Live Playlist As Features In Batch 106Each batch of Blackened uses Metallica’s music to literally shape the whiskey. Using the proprietary sonic-enhancement process Black NoiseTM, the low hertz frequencies pummel the black brandy casks during the finishing, extracting more flavor form the wood. Visit BlackenedWhiskey. com to learn how you can receive a limited edition S&amp;M T-Shirt commemorating this very special batch. BlackenedWhiskey. com @BlackenedAmericanWhiskey #WhiskeyRemasteredPlease Enjoy Responsibly. The blackened bottle is a round 750ml glass bottle, this one doesn’t differ from previous batches except for the label on the neck designating Batch 106. The front of the bottle reads::  Batch 106BlackenedA blend of straight whiskeys finished in black brandy casksRe-mastered by Dave Pickerell750 ML45% ALC/VOL(90 Proof) The back of the bottle reads::  Blacken The WorldBlackened. A bold collaboration of the finest, hand selected whiskeys. An unrivaled composition of craft &amp; creativity. Born in cask, forged by sound. Bottled by Sweet Amber Distilling Co. Mineville, NY.

    "body": "2020/12/13 - The 2020 Special Release bottle from Jack Daniel’s, following the past two year’s Heritage Barrel releases, is a Barrel Proof Rye. The bottle is simply beautiful, see photos above and below! This has not been the easiest bottle to find here in Missouri, in fact, I haven’t been made aware of any bottles in the state of Missouri or Illinois yet. Every morning I wake up and search online via 6 or so websites, trying to find a somewhat location retailer who has them. Back on November 23rd I found a bottle online via Cask Cartel and placed an order. It was for above retail price, but I was worried it might be the only bottle I get access to, so I went ahead and placed the order. Since then the price has gone up to $249/bottle and recently to the point where you can’t even buy a bottle, only a case (at close to $1500). I continue to search, I would love to find another bottle so that I can open one! I hope that they show up here in Missouri in the next week or two, but we’ll see if that plays out. Now on to the bottle review. The bottle is very similar to the heriage release bottle of the past two years, only with some tweaks for the 2020 Special Release Rye. It comes with a hang tag in green with gold lettering, the front of which reads:  Jack Daniel’s Uniquely Crafted Handmade BarrelsSingle Barrel Special Release Barrel Proof Rye2020 Limited Edition The rear of the tag reads:  Master Distiller Jeff Arnett and his team of whiskey makers created this special release to honow the history of American whiskey when it was often high in rye content and offered at barrel strength. Maturing in the reaches of Barrel House #1-02 has delivered a deep copper hue with a nose that opens to an aroma full of smoke and raisin. Each sip lingers with molasses, sawn oak, and bold rye spice. The front of the bottle reads similar to the front of the hang tag, with a few additions.

    "body": "2020/12/08 - I am simply not sure if I’ll make it to Lynchburg this year or not to see the Barrel Tree. I had really hoped to, but with everything going on, it simply doesn’t look like that trip will happen. For the past few weeks I’ve been slowly printing my own barrel tree! Via a work whiskey Facebook group I came across someone who was 3D printing barrels, and mentioned being able to stain them, which to me meant that they were wood. I did some googling and came across that there is PLA filament for 3D printers that has wood fiber in it. Off to Amazon I ran to try and find some when I came across Pla Wood Filament Wood Filament 3D Printer Pla Wood Fill Pla Wood 1. 75mm, Rohs Compliance, 1 kg Spool, Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0. 03 mm Pla Wood Color. I already had a 3D barrel that I had designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 a while back (2020? 2019? I don’t recall), so I just needed to resize it to try and see if I could get a barrel tree started. I ended up with a lot of success, and multiple failures, before I figured out that I should set my print head at 207 degrees celcius in order to prevent issues at a lower temp (started at 200c). I also tweaked the design a bit, figuring I didn’t actually need to print “bottoms” on the barrels, just tops (printed upside down with support for the bottom/top). This helped to save some print time and filament. I ended up printing somewhere around 32 barrels, averaging 3 to 4 a day. I stained the first few barrels with a foam brush, but ended up just dipping most of the barrels in the golden oak wood stain. The final tree has 26 barrels in it, starting at the top layer 1, 3, 6, 7, 9 at the base, glued on to an old Xbox 360 HD DVD drive installation disk (it was green, and who realy needs that disk anymore?) I picked up some little battery powered LED lights from Home Depot a few weeks back for the project and wrapped them around the tree, with a few dabs of hot glue to help keep them in place. After setting up the tree on my little photo shoot location I figured it was far too “plain” so I grabbed some fake snow and a few other Jack Daniel’s items to add to the scenery for the shot here on this page. I’m thinking I’ll keep the barrel tree for next year and add a layer or town to make it bigger each year! In the photos below you’ll find the finished product, as well as an assortment of photos throughout the build. I went ahead and uploaded my STL file to Thingiverse if you want to try to print your own barrels. Thingiverse Link "

    "body": "2020/11/30 - Ultimately we need to do a blog post on Nathan “Nearest” Green, and his story within the world of Jack Daniel’s, but today we’re simply going to highlight the Uncle Nearest 1820 bottle of 11 year aged premium whiskey. This bottle has been hard to find, I acquired my first one by chance, through a raffle at a local store here in St. Louis. I obtained an entry buy purchasing some 1856 and 1884 bottles of Uncle Nearest (future posts on those coming). I had the fortune of spending some time on a virtual whiskey tasting with a family member of Nathan Green and enjoyed it, that plus the ties to Jack Daniel’s made me an immediate fan of their product, but the fact that it tastes great too also helps! The 1820 bottle is a single barrel, picked by founders of the Uncle Nearest distillery. The bottle is the same shape as the other Uncle Nearest bottles, only differing in label. The 1820 bottle has green labelling around the sides, while the 1856 has maroon and the 1884 has a vanilla color. The front label reads:  Smoothest Whiskey in TennesseeUncle Nearest 1820Premium Whiskey Aged 11 YearsNearest Green Single Barrel EditionMaple Charcoal FilteredAged in Charred Oak Barrels The label at the bottom of the front reads the alcohol percentage (59. 4), proof (118. 8) and the bottle number (US-27) The rear label reads:  Uncle Nearest 1820Premium Whiskey Aged 11 YearsAstonishingly smooth with a gentle finish, Uncle Nearest 1820 is inspired by the best whiskey maker the world never knew. Tennessee’s premiere master distiller and teacher, Nathan “Nearest” Green helped perfect the distinctive maple charcoal filtering that exemplifies the best of american whiskey. An 11-year old barre, hand selected and chosen by our founders, Nerest Green (TM) SIngle Barrel Edition pays tribute to his legacy and craft. Every drop tells a story. 9/108 I am assuming this is bottle 9 out of 108 for the barrel. You might be able to order this bottle online, the Nearest Green Distillery has offered it up a couple of times this holiday season through ReserveBar. com. Good luck! Specs: Release: VariesProof: 118. 8Size: 750 mlPrice: $110 How Much Is Uncle Nearest 1820 Worth?: As of June 2024, this bottle can be found online for around $149. Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment: If you can pick up a bottle or two, I recommend it. The value on some of the original releases will likely only climb as the popularity and growth of the Uncle Nearest brand doesn’t appear to be cooling anytime soon. "

That being said, I haven’t seen one in Missouri since early October (I was able to get some from Total Wine here in the St. Louis area). Which is a step up from last year. I had to drive to Memphis to find one, I couldn’t find them in St. Louis until January. Once they were here though, Lukas (Dogwood) had them until late summer, I may have purchased a case of them late in the summer. This year’s box doesn’t vary much from last year’s. The design on the outside is new, and they also included Tennessee Apple.

While old traditions warm the heart, there’s something special about starting a new one. We hope that as you open a new calendar door, you’ll share a toast with the folks closest to you. The front of the box has 24 boxes, one for each day, with various scenes around Lunchburg with the Jack Daniel’s statue front and center. Some of the scenes include the Hardware Store, Jack Daniel’s grave, Miss Mary Bobo’s, The Motlow House and Jack’s Office. The sides and rear of the box read:  Jack Daniel’s Distillery Lynchburg Tenn.

There was a 161st birthday bottle, with square corners, released in the UK in 2011. The bottle is the older familiar rounded corner design.

    "body": "2020/09/13 - In September 2020, I received an email via my website asking if I might be interested in a bottle / decanter for sale.  I am in the process of liquidating estate items.  One of the items is a Jack Daniels decanter “Riverboat Captain’s Bottle”.  I have not found any way to sell on the internet and maybe you have some idea how to sell to a collector.  This is an unsealed full bottle of 90 proof.  It also has the box, and tag (unregistered).  I would be glad to send pictures if I had your email address.  Any help would be appreciated. This was actually the second time that someone had reached out to me in the past couple of weeks asking me about items that they were trying to sell from a family member. Both peaked my interest, but this particular email worked out because the seller was in Des Moines, about 340 miles from St. Louis. The other inquiry was from near Knoxville, which is about 500 miles from where I live. I replied back to the inquiry and let them know I would be interested in the Riverboat Captain’s Bottle, after a few emails back and forth we settled on a price and the seller even offered to meet me near Kansas City. Not quite on the most direct route to Des Moines, but still close enough for a day’s round trip drive. I got up early this morning, changed the tires on the car, and headed off. Why did I need to change the tires? I decided to drive the FR-S, and had the “good” tires on it, with a few hundred mile drive, I didn’t feel like putting those miles on the tires with a few autocross events left in 2020, so I threw the stock wheels and cheap tires back on the car and took off west. Riverboat Captain’s Bottle Box: The Riverboat Captain’s Bottle comes with a large box, with a riverboat picture on three sides, and text and a photo of the bottle on the rear. This particular box has a price tag on it, $29. 99, imagine that. Back in 1987, this bottle could have been purchased for $30. Today it goes for north of $600 online. The rear of the box reads:  He was a fine high-minded man, and greatly respected both ashore and on the river. He was very tall, well built and handsome; and in his old age - as I remember him - his hair was black as an Indian’s and his eye and hand were strong and steady and his nerve and judgement as firm and dear as anybody’s young or old, among the FRATERNITY of PILOTS. Mark Twain Hang Tag: The bottle came with a hang tag in black and gold, with red, and quite a bit of text. The front of the hang tag read:  Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7. Riverboat Captain’s BottleHe was a fine high-minded man, and greatly respected both ashore and on the river. He was very tall, well built and handsome; and in his old age - as I remember him - his hair was black as an Indian’s and his eye and hand were strong and steady and his nerve and judgement as firm and dear as anybody’s young or old, among the FRATERNITY of PILOTS. Mark Twain The inside of the hang tag read:  Getting Old No. 7 Aboard the Floating PalacesSince he was a traveling whiskey salesman, Mr. Jack Daniel could be found in Nashville almost as often as in Lynchburg. And one of those natural attractions of the city in those days was the wharf at the end of Broad Street.  To most folks, the visiting packets, showboats and tinsel-covered steamers, plus the sign of towering cotton bales and tobacco being carries by mules and roustabouts made the riverport one of the most exciting places on earth.  But what intrigued Mr. Daniel about the riverfront signs was the abundance of “the carriage trade” awaiting passage to far-off places. If Old No. 7 won the approval of these folks, it would add considerable to his product’s growing reputation. That’s when Mr. Jack resolved to court the favor of the riverboat captain.  Amongst the waiting congregation, the most noticeable individual was the riverboat captain. A dramatic presence, dressed in a glimmer of white or the luster of polished black, the Captain did not merely participate in riverport gatherings, he presided over them.  He’d tip his hate to the ladies and invite affluent planters and other members of the gentry on board for conversation. These gatherings inevitably led to a sampling of superb cigars and fine whiskey from Captain’s private stock.  For in the end, the riverboat captain was a businessman who understood that a steamboat with a fine reputation for accommodations – staterooms, food and drink – would prosper.  Mr. Jack Daniel knew it too. That’s why he approached the riverboat captain of the Tennessee Belle with a most generous proposition.  “Sir, I have travelled far and wide selling my fine Tennessee sippin ‘whiskey and never had less than praiseworthy reports from my customers. It’s as fine a potable as you could offer to your personal friends. All I ask is you take one sip. If you like it, I’ll see to it that your bottle is filled with Old. No. 7 every time you visit Nashville. ”  Mr. Jack believed that a sip of Tennessee’s finest was all it would take to convince the most contrary soul. And once it became the personal choice of the captain, Uncle Jack knew his Old Number 7 would soon find its way to the taverns in the steamboat’s grand salon, where it could be consumed and appreciated by the “the carriage trade. ”  So, for years to come, spectators at the Nashville wharf became accustomed to seeing several kegs of Old No. 7, along with the mules and roustabouts, the bales of cotton and tobacco, all anticipating the arrival of steamboats.  Even at the turn of the century, when steamboat travel was in its decline, a visiting riverboat captain might be overheard asking the whereabouts of Mr. Jack Daniel. Whether Mr. Jack was on hand or not, there was always an ample supply of his fine Tennessee sippin’ whiskey reserved for the steamboat master’s personal bottle. After all, a deal’s a deal.  The bottle you hold, the RIVERBOARD CAPTAIN’S BOTTLE, was created to reflect the elegance of the days when steamboats ruled the great waters of our nation. The bell design tapers into a perfectly flat bottom to discourage tipping, a feature the Captains of the era fully appreciated in times of rough waters.  You’ll be pleased to know that the whiskey inside your RIVERBOAT CAPTAIN’S BOTTLE is still made the old way – the same mellow potable Mr. Jack Daniel offered to the carriage trade of the steamboat age. The Bottle: The bottle itself is adorned with only a strip around the neck and the words Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 on the front. I am super stoked about this bottle myself. I can’t wait to build my shelving/storage so that I can properly display this bottle. The box I received has seen better days, it still holds it’s shape, and will hold the bottle. I don’t know how I will display the box in the future. Specs: Release: 1987Proof: 90Size: 1. 75LPrice: $29. 99 How Much Is Jack Daniel’s Riverboat Captain’s Bottle Worth?: You’ll find values for this bottle all over the place on the web. Most of the “ads” you see for liquor stores who still have a bottle, if they do, are nearly $1800, but you can find the bottle for way cheaper than that. Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment: Don’t spend more then $500 for a bottle, maybe $600 if the box is in GREAT shape. "

    "body": "2020/09/03 - September is the accepted Birth Month of Jack Daniel’s, so every September there is a month long celebration with photos and stories that are posted online. This month however is a little different, it was announced yesterday that Master Distiller Jeff Arnett will be stepping down at the end of September 2020, and leaving Jack Daniel’s. No further details have been provided, is he retiring, going somewhere else? Jeff was brought on to replace Jimmy ‘Bobo’ Bedford in 2008 and was listed as the 7th Master Distiller, Number 7, for this iconic brand. There is debate nowadays as to weather he is actually number 7, or number 8, as the Jack Daniel’s brand starts to recognize Nathan ‘Nearest’ Green and his importance to the history of the business. That doesn’t take anything away from what Jeff has done for the brand in his time. He has brought a new mashbill to Jack Daniel’s with the introduction of their Rye products, as well as expanding the offerings of the brand with the flavored offerings of Honey, Fire and Apple. I was fortunate to get to say hello to Jeff back in December 2014 during the bottle signing event for the Holiday Select release, the last time JD has offered that release. The photos on this post are from that event. A Letter to Jeff:  Dear Jeff,  Thanks for everything you’ve done for the Jack Daniel’s Brand in your 12 years as Master Distiller and 20 years as an employee. Best wishes with whatever the future brings you. Anytime you are in the St. Louis area, feel free to swing by for a drink!  -Collector Of Jack Who will take Jeff’s Place and be the next Master Distiller?: Word is that Brown Foreman will make the announcement for Jeff’s replacement in the future. I think Chris Fletcher, Assistant Master Distiller, is obviously a potential pick, but he’s rather young, will that play into the decision? Will the brand try to fill the role with someone who provides more diversity to the brand? In today’s day and age, I would assume that BF is looking at this as an option. I don’t know that I have an opinion as to which direction they should go, but I look forward to following along as the brand continues to mature and age. "

    "body": "2020/09/02 - In 1995 Jack Daniel’s released a 750ml bottle to celebrate the State of Tennessee’s Bicentennial for the year 1996. This replica of the 1896 Centennial bottle that Jack Daniel produced in limited quantities was available in in the US, and in international markets in a 700ml size. It is said that Jack Daniel himself designed this bottle 100 years earlier for the Tennessee centennial. The front of the bottle reads::  Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Bicentennial Whiskey 1796-1996 The hang tag reads::  In honor of our state’s 200th birthday, we’d like to share a simple salute with you. Our Tennessee Bicentennial Bottle is a replica of the Centennial Decanter Mr. Jack designed back in 1896. And, like the decanter the whiskey inside has remained true to the original except for one special difference-it’s bottled at 96 proof in honor of this bicentennial year. Here’s to the enduring spirit of Tennessee tradition. 1796-1996 Where did you get it?: I got this bottle from my father. Where he got it, we aren’t quite sure. It has never been opened, still had the hang tag on it, and he has no other collectible bottles. For as long as I can remember, my dad has always drank Jack and Coke, almost ritually, one every night after work. Never more, never less. It is possible that he purchased it back in 1995, but my guess is that he likely recieved it as a retirement gift from someone when he retired from the Air Force in 1998. Where To Buy: You might be able to find the bottle online, though prices will very wildly. Anywhere from a couple hundred dollars, to wayyyyy more than that. Release: 1995Proof: 96Size: 750mlPrice: $Unknown How Much Is Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Bicentennial Worth?: The value of the Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Bicentennial online ranges from $600 to nearly $1200. Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment: If you can find one of these bottles for less than $600 you need one of these in your collection! I might have an extra, feel free to reach out. "

    "body": "2020/08/31 - In July/August 2020 Jack Daniel’s released the 2020 version of the Eric Church Single Barrel Select bottle, a follow on release after their 2019 Eric Church Double Down Tour Single Barrel. This year’s bottle is a beautiful opaque black with a black and gold label. It came with a paper hang tag, also in black and gold. The front of the label, and the front of the hang tag reads::  Special Edition Jack Daniel’s Eric Church Single Barrel Select Tennessee Whiskey The rear of the hang tag reads::  Music and friendships were always important to Mr. Jack. That’s why we are proud to offer this special edition Jack Daniel’s single barrel package celebrating our longstanding friendship with Eric Church who shares Jack Daniel’s spirit of Community. In 2013 Eric and his wife, Katherine, created the non-profit “Chief Cares Fund” to impact lives around the globe and in our own neighborhoods.  For more information go to: www. ericchurch. com/chief-cares The rear of the bottle reads::  This special edition Jack Daniel’s single barrel package celebrates our friendship with Eric Church. Master Distiller, Jeff Arnett hand-selected this 94 proof single barrel Tennessee Whiskey according to Eric Church’s favorite Jack Daniel’s taste profile. In the photos below you might notice a metal hang tag as well. That tag was created by the Sunshine State Squires group on Facebook and available for purchase through them, though I don’t believe it is still available for purchase. There are a variety of dates of bottling for the 2020 edition of the Eric Church release, with some dates in June 2020 and July 2020. I have bottles with both 6/26/2020 and 7/23/2020 bottling dates. The Hunt: The Eric Church Single Barrel release was a hard to find bottle in 2020, selling very quickly where available. On Wednesday July 29th I was able to track down a bottle in Texas which I ordered and had a family member pick up. That order is still sitting in my cousin’s house in Texas until we can find a time to meet up post covid. I found that Total Wine in Fairview Heights Illinois had it available online the morning of Saturday August 1st. I quickly placed an order for 3, packed the kids up in the car and headed out to run errands that morning. I was tempted to drive straight to IL to get them, but decided to stop and pick up a few fishing supplies before our camping trip that week. While shopping in Cabela’s I missed a call from Fairview Heights, I returned the call and was told that the bottles on the shelf were all sold in 1. 5 hours, before they could pull my online order, so they were cancelling the order. Missed opportunity #1. On Wednesday August 12th a buddy of mine was able to locate availability via an online retailer in Florida. I placed an order of 2 bottles, one for me, one for him. Shortly after receiving that order the bottle also started showing up in the St. Louis market. In St. Louis I had a few interesting hunts. I was pretty much hitting the local shops almost daily, Total Wine and More in Chesterfield, Dogwood Liquors in Ellisville, The Wine and Cheese Place in Chesterfield, Randalls, without any luck. All the locations when asked about the Eric Church bottle said they had more questions about that bottle than anything else, and they had no idea when/how many they would get. One evening in a local bourbon group I saw rumors that Total Wine down in Town &amp; Country had a bottle, so I headed off under the guise of buying school supplies for the kids and hit TW first. They had 5 bottles at the time, with a limit of purchasing 1 per person. I picked up a bottle and alerted a few friends who might be interested in picking one up. I then went to Wal-Mart with my son and purchased the needed school supplies, along with a $5 long sleeve T-Shirt for myself. After leaving Wal-Mart I changed my shirt, put on a different (covid) mask and went back to Total Wine and acquired a second bottle. I totally felt like a rebel. There were still 4 bottles visible on the shelf when I arrived, 3 when I left. A buddy of mine went at 9am the next morning and got a bottle from the same location. Later that next evening I went to Total Wine T&amp;C again, the shelf row where the bottles were was empty, and the tag showed the dreaded green “out of stock” message that Total Wine uses. I was dejected, I had been hoping to grab a bottle for a friend. I decided I would dig a little bit, and guess what I found? One last bottle of Eric Church mixed in with the other Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel options. I grabbed it and checked out! I continued to check for more bottles at the TW in Chesterfield, each time apparently just missing when they had them available. From what I could gather, they had at least 3 cases available, one was out on Saturday August 23rd, another on Friday August 28th and early in the morning on Saturday August 29th. On Friday the 28th, I found another source online that showed the EC release was available in St. Louis. I placed an online order, trying to get three bottles from the location, and then “waited” for the order to be accepted. By the end of the work day, I was still waiting. I took off after work and went up to North County to the location that showed as having a bottle online, and was able to purchase one bottle at a price of $64 plus tax. The next day I received a cancellation of my online order, saying they were out of stock. Online however that location still shows availability. After the successful pickup, I stopped at a variety of other liquor stores on my way back over to west county and only found one more store that had any in stock. There is a liquor store on the Rock Road, I won’t name it, the girl behind the counter said they had some, but she wasn’t sure if she could sell it, it was under the counter behind the register. She called someone and asked them about the bottle, they told her she could sell it. She told me it was $250, I laughed as I walked out the door. I’ll keep hunting, a big part of the enjoyment in this whiskey game is that hunt. Where To Buy: You can still find the bottle online, though not at many locations that will ship out of their home states. Bottle price as of August 2020 varies from $60 up to $250.

One a post there one day she mentioned the Sunshine State Squires and Collectors Facebook Group out of Florida, and that they were putting together some special edition bottles, and had previously done a few bottles as well. The first bottle that I learned about is one I hope to write about in the next week or two, as I don’t have it yet, but today I received my first bottle from the group. This bottle was put together for the 2020 Daytona Beach Bike Week. The bottle is a single barrel selection chosen by the group, and contains a number of very cool things! The first, most noticeable item is the custom sleeve, with a photoshopped picture combining Easy Rider and the ocean. It also contains a hang tag reading “Daytona Beach Bike Week 2020”. It contains a sticker, a coaster, and a custom coin, along with an etched bottle.

    "title": "My first whiskey tasting event",
    "body": "2020/02/13 - I’ve been threatening for months that I was going to have a whiskey tasting event, this past Friday I finally did it. This post contains an overview of how I planned, how the event went and what lessons learned for future events. Planning: The biggest hurdle to this event was just picking a date, for months I haven’t been able to get a date on the calendar, so in late January I threw one up (February 7th) and created a private Facebook event with info. I then sent the invite out to a small group of friends, some of which I had been talking about the event with for months. In the Facebook I included a list of various bottles that I had acquired for the purpose of drinking over the past year, including selections of Jack Daniel’s, and non Jack Daniel’s bottles. I also requested that everyone bring an unopened bottle of their own, an if they felt like leaving it afterward they could. I ended up extending the invites out to 11 people, 8 of whom were able to make it. As I neared the date I started prepping some things.  I cleaned all my whiskey glasses, and wine glasses (not for use, but because they hadn’t been washed in…. years) I purchased some new tasting glasses, 8 of them, shaped like Glencairn glasses, but not the brand.  I did a little reading on how best to host a whiskey tasting. (Google it) I posted a link to an article about “infinity” bottles, or the idea of filling up a decanter with a variety of different whiskeys, either when a bottle is opened, or as a bottle nears it’s completion. I suggested everyone bring a decanter and we could see about filling them up.  I changed my mind about everyone bringing a decanter, and decided that I was going to buy some moonshine bottles and personalize them for the event (see the photos below, I think they turned out great).  Made a selection of ice for the event, for anyone who wanted ice in their glasses (not everyone did). At 5pm that evening I headed to the local grocery store, hoping to score some snacks, and hoping to score some whiskey for the night. In the local Bourbon Facebook group there were substantiated rumors that you could find some Weller’s Reserve and Eagle Rare at the Dierberg’s around town, so I headed to the Wildwood location with hopes of finding one or both. I was able to fill up the cart with snacks, and a bottle of the Dierberg’s Single Barrel selection of the Eagle Rare. Final prep for the night of including getting the dining room table extended and bringing extra chairs up from the basement. I also picked up some crackers and pizza bites to warm up, in case anyone was hungry for something. The pizza bites didn’t last an hour. Event Experience: Come the night of I was ready about an hour before the scheduled start time, so I sat down to read my copy of The Whiskey Advocate that mysteriously showed up in my mailbox a week ago. When the first guests showed up we took a seat in the kitchen and caught up a bit waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive. As everyone showed up, all bringing a bottle of their choice, I gave a tour of the basement where I keep my “undrinkables”, my Jack Daniel’s collection. From there we took our seats at the dining room table, the location for the tasting, and I passed out the custom decanters. Everyone got to choose a glass from the table, and then I tried to determine what we would start with. My original list on the invite had probably 12 different bottles of mine that I wanted to use, but I quickly realized that wasn’t going to be realistic, so we started with the guest provided bottles and mixed in 4 or 5 of mine throughout the night. Everyone got a “dram”, a small pour, supposed to be 3/4 of an OZ, but unmeasured on my pours. We went in the following order:  Eagle Rare (90 Proof) Knob Creek Smoked Maple (90 proof) Tamdhu Scotch (96 Proof) New Riff Kentucky Straight Rye Bottled In Bond (100 proof) Breckenridge Bourbon Whiskey (86 proof) Sons of Erin Irish Whiskey (92 Proof) Woodford Reserve (90. 4 Proof) Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye (86 Proof) Blanton’s (93 Proof) Jack Daniel’s Heritage Barrel 2019 (100 Proof) Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold (80 proof) George Dickel Bottled in Bond (100 proof)Outside of the tasting a few of us tried Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie, a scottish barley, which we mostly immediately regretted. We had quite the variety of things to choose from on our first tasting. In the future we’ll have to decide if we want to try that many in one go again or not. Overall consensus was that the Blanton’s was the best. After that it was mixed, but I think the Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold was extra smooth and drinkable. Definitely glad we cracked that one open. My buddy who brought the Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye brought me another bottle, we didn’t open it, but I did get to keep it. It is a 100 Proof bottle of The Legendary Hatfield &amp; McCoy Family Brand Whiskey. I spent a few minutes looking online, and no proof of this bottle’s existence can be found (you can find the 80 proof version, but I don’t think 100 proof ever went to retail), how cool is that? Lessons Learned: One, have fun. This was a great damn time. Invite some good friends, and invite some people you might not know that well. If you can get everyone to bring/leave a bottle, you can build up your collection! Be prepared, there was no way I had enough glasses for 9 people to try 12 different drinks. What we ended up doing was putting a bowl on each end of the table, and a pitcher of water. Rinsing the glasses out in between drams. This worked out pretty well, though I’m sure purists might cringe at the idea. Doing an infinite bottle/decanter might not make sense at a tasting like this, maybe that comes with some sort of a bring a bottle/trade pours type of thing. If I do this again in the future, no, not if, WHEN I do this again in the future, I will have to come up with another parting gift for everyone who attends. I am already trying to figure out when the next one is, likely in April 2020. Thinking I’ve got enough special edition Jack Daniel’s bottles we can crack open (in my drinkable selection) that we might just do a Night Dedicated To Jack Daniels. "

    "body": "2019/12/29 - In the fall of 2019 rumors started swirling online of a new release available at the White Rabbit Bottleshop in Lynchburg, of a Before and After set. Two bottles of unmatured Old No. 7, one BEFORE Charcoal Mellowing and one AFTER Charcoal Mellowing, along with a small bottle of Hard Sugar Maple Charcoal in between the two bottles. The BEFORE bottle on the left, the AFTER on the right. It ends up the package was exclusive to Tennessee, and could be found at a variety of locations around the state. I lined up a set with a local in Lynchburg, and planned to get it in the mail, trading for a Scenes of Lynchburg series bottle, but got cold feet before shipping and ended up committing to the other party that I would trade in person next time I make it to Lynchburg. In November I made a trek south from St. Louis down to Memphis and picked up two packages of the Before and After set, maintaining my intention of getting the third set mentioned above. The bottles and charcoal come in a black box, the bottles with a white label with black text. The bottles are 375ml, with whiskey aged only one day. This set has a lot of writing on it, so I am not going to transcribe all of that writing this time around, but will include a couple of interesting bits. Tasting Directions:  1) Pour an ounce of our before charcoal mellowing whiskey into a tasking glass. Without mellowing, it’s nose has extra cereal notes and its taste is more harsh and oily in character. 2) Pour an ounce of our after charcoal mellowing whiskey into a second glass. Because this whiskey has been mellowed drop by drop, you’ll notice its nose and taste is smoother and cleaner. It is absent the grainy character of the before mellowing Jack Daniel’s. One last thing, the bottle mentions a URL, jackdaniels. com/BEFORE-AFTER but as of December 28th, 2019, the URL only leads to a 404 page.

I spent quite a bit of time this fall trying to find this calendar in the St. Louis market, but no stores that I talked to knew anything about it, and from what I can tell no one in the St. Louis market got any in for sale.

The front of the box reads  Jack Daniel Distillery Lynchburg Tenn. Holiday Countdown Calendar The back has the logos, and a description of each of the various libations along with:  Happy Holidays from Our Family to YoursIn Lynchburg, Tennessee, the holidays are about traditions old and new. While old traditions warm the heart, there’s something special about starting a new one. We hope that as you open a new calendar door, you’ll share a toast with the folks closest to you. Each day, the 1st through the 24th, has a separate door that you open to find the present for the day. In the first week or so you’ll find three shot glasses, the fourth one comes later in the month. The doors can be a little difficult to open without causing bending of the cardboard, but if you’re careful it can be done. If you can get your hands on one of these countdown calendars, enjoy!

For 2019, Jack Daniels has once again released Heritage Barrel, this time, aging it 1 year more, and the rumors in collecting communities say that they bottled fewer barrels this year. Bottles were bottled on both 9/9/2019 and 9/10/2019, though rumors also say that there were fewer bottles bottled on the 10th. Finding a bottle this year was difficult to say the least. I spent weeks driving to liquor stores, calling liquor stores, and looking online, to see if I could find a bottle. I got the run around at the Chesterfield Total Wine. Depending on who I asked I was told it hadn’t come yet, or that it came weeks ago and was already gone. Lukas Liquors in Ellisville, MO came through though. They were super responsive on twitter, and super helpful when I was in the store multiple times inquiring about the bottle. They reached out via DM on twitter on Thursday, saying that the bottles had arrived and they were holding one for me! I took off at lunch and went to pick it up, not wanting to risk the bottle being sold to someone else!

Notes: Rested at least 228 days in win barrel. As a whiskey maker and a barrel maker, we see the barrel not simply as a container but as an ingredient. This unique whiskey began with a hand-crafted barrel that matured Jack Danie’s. Once emptied it aged fine Tennessee red wine. Then, finally it returned home to finish a small batch of our Tennessee Whiskey. What emerges from this second barreling are notes of caramel and oak with whispers of cherry and blackberry. We think you’ll be intrigued by this new finish and celebrate with us the reunion of our barrel and whiskey. I picked up a few of these bottles at the Distillery in March 2019 and then picked up another bottle in Memphis on a trip in April.

This bottle, unlike all the other Holiday Select bottles comes in a box that has the face cut out to showcase the bottle.

The Sides of the box read Limited Edition 2014, while the back of the box (and the bottle) reads:  The 2014 bottling marks the first time I have chosen our Holiday Select barrels to be bottled individually. This year I wanted to showcase the depth and richness that a single barrel can offer and selected the most robust and complex whiskey I sampled. Each barrel is truly unique and we hope the bottle you’ve selected helps make your holiday special. - Jeff Arnette, Master Distiller The shape of the bottle is a bit different than the earlier Holiday Select bottles as the Jack Daniel’s signature is towards the top, instead off on the right side as with the earlier bottles. The labelling on the bottle is a mixture of white and gold, and reads Limited Edition 2014 Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Holiday Select Small Batch. The holly berry from earlier releases is missing. In the photos below you’ll see two different bottles, one still boxed up, and one that I drank. For the 2014 Holiday Select release, I took my Family to Lynchburg, TN for the Jack Daniel’s barrel tree lighting and bottle signing event. I purchased a case of the 2014 Holiday Select bottles, and had those signed by Jeff Arnett and Chris Fletcher (Assistant Distiller). I gave most of the bottles away as gifts to friends and family, but kept three bottles for myself, one of which I chose to drink. That would be the empty bottle in the photos below. The 2014 bottle is 48% Alcohol, or 96 Proof, down from 98 the year before. You can find it online at a few retailers, best price/stock I found was $199 as of December 10, 2018.

The bottle comes in a black box, but unlike 2011 this box isn’t a clamshell opening. The bottle and an insert slide out the top of the box. The back of the box reads:  THIS JACK DANIEL’S LIMITED EDITION IS FROM BARRELS WE USED TO CRAFT OUR HOLIDAY BARREL TREE. FOR 2012, OUR MASTER DISTILLER, JEFF ARNETT, HAS SELECTED BARRELS WITH A LIGHT OAK CHARACTER, ALLOWING THE SOFTWARE NOTES OF VANILLA AND CARAMEL TO SHINE THROUGH. WE HOPE IT BRINGS A SPECIAL QUALITY TO YOUR HOLIDAY SEASON. The shape of the bottle is the same as the 2011 bottle, but the labelling has some gold instead of all white. The holly berry leaves are also in green, instead of the white as in 2011. Also differing from the 2011 bottle, the text on the back of the bottle now matches the text on the back of the box. The 2012 bottle is 45. 2% Alcohol, or 90. 4 Proof, down from 100 the year before. Finding this one online appears a little more difficult, I found one on ebay listed at $165 as of December 5, 2018. Release: December 2012Proof: 90. 4Size: 750ml How Much Is Jack Daniel’s Holiday Select Release from 2012: Originally priced around $89, you’ll be hard pressed to find it for anything less than $300 Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment: If you can find it for under $250 you should pick it up!

    "body": "2019/06/18 - The Jack Daniel’s Legacy Edition Series is a new line of bottles, with the First Edition, being released in fall 2018. The bottle sells for about the same price as your average 1/5th (750ml) of Old No. 7, and can be found in markets all over the United States (from our own experience we have found it in Nebraska and Missouri so far). This First Edition bottle commemorates the colorful history of the Jack Daniel’s label, often associated with the tried and true Black and White label. This green and gold trimmed label was used some time before 1904, and has a nice red background behind the Old No. 7 emblem. The Jack Daniel’s inside is bottled at 86 proof. It’ll be interesting to see what additional bottles are released under the Legacy Edition Series bottles. Release: Summer 2018 Proof: 86 Size: 750mlPrice: $35 "

    "body": "2019/06/18 - In late September 2018 Jack Daniel’s announced a new Special Release Tennessee Whiskey, Single Barrel Heritage Barrel.  This release celebrates the early craftsmanship of the Jack Daniel Distillery. The whiskey is from uniquely crafted heavy-toast barrels and 100 proof barrel entry proof. The “Heritage Barrel” expression of Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel was crafted with a low temperature, heavy toasted barrel which created a light but rich char full of deep flavor. A lower 100 proof entry proof allows our grain bill to assert itself creating a special Tennessee whiskey with notes of light baking spices, vanilla, and toasted oak with a long, lingering finish, aged to perfection at the top of one of the highest elevated barrelhouses, 1-09, on Coy Hill. What emerges is a flavorful and rich Tennessee Whiskey. JackDaniels. com The included cardboard wrapped on the neck of the bottle, reads:  Master Distiller Jeff Arnett and his team of whiskey makers created a truly unique whiskey for this special release of Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel. The “Heritage Barrel” expression of Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel was crafted with a low temperature, heavy toasted barrel which creates a light but rich char full of deep flavor. A lower 100 entry proof allows our grain bill to assert itself creating a special Tennessee Whiskey with notes of light baking spices, vanilla, and toasted oak with long, lingering finish. Aged to perfection at the top of one of the highest elevated barrelhouses, 1-09, on Coy Hill. What emerges is a flavorful and rich Tennessee Whiskey that we think you’ll appreciate.  Tasting NotesAroma - Rich vanilla and sweet baking spices on the nose. Taste - Warm notes of vanilla and caramel give way to dark fruit and spice. Finish - Lingering finish of rich oak spice with a subtle grain sweetness. I’ve looked at the local haunts here in the St. Louis area to try to locate the Heritage Barrel, but I’ve yet to find anyone who has it. Lucas Liquors tells me (via twitter) that they might be available here before Christmas. The gentleman at 141 Liquors tells me that his distributor says they won’t see any before May. Based on this info so far, I doubt they’ll make it to Missouri at all considering the release is limited to 200 total barrels. I was fortunate enough to only stumble upon it online after doing some searching one weekend. I found it on a website called SipWhiskey. com, and while their communication/customer service left some things to be desired, and their packing of the bottle made me seriously question if it would still be intact when I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised that I received bottle in perfect shape. Unfortunately their website says they are out of stock now, but perhaps they will get it back in stock again soon. Good luck hunting! Release: Fall 2018Proof: 100Size: 750mlPrice: $89 "

The bottle is labelled as “Tennessee Whiskey Finish with Charred Hickory Staves”.  Smoked Hickory Finish - a fully matured whiskey finished with charred hickory staves for a smoky flavor at 100-proof, just in time for the 30th annual Jack Daniel’s World Championship Invitational BBQ which is held in Lynchburg on Oct. 27.

Jack Daniel’s Press Release This selection was from master taster Marsha Hale, whom according to her Linked In profile has worked at Jack Daniel’s for almost 31 years. I have yet to decide if I will try these bottles myself. I do have two of each, with the original intention of keeping one and having the other for trading to fill my collection with missing items. If however I could come across some other bottles, I would likely try one out myself, only time will tell if that happens. Release: October 2018Proof: 100Size: 375mlPrice: $49 "

    "body": "2019/06/18 - In October 2018 Jack Daniel’s put out a press release announcing a new Tasters’ Series of bottles/releases. I won’t go into the full details of the press release, you can read it here, but I do want to document the releases as I acquire them! Towards the end of the month they released the first two bottles in the series, High Angel’s Share Barrels and Smoked Hickory Finish. This post is about the High Angel’s Share Barrels release. High Angel’s Share Barrels - whiskey barreled in January 2013 which offered an unusually low yield, presenting a unique and deep concentration of flavors with a dark color at 107-proof. Selected by Assistant Master Distiller and Master Taster Chris Fletcher. Available early-October. These releases, are limited to around 24,000 bottles, and only available at the Distillery and in select stores in Tennessee. This had caused me to start looking at making a trip to Lynchburg to pick up some bottles for myself, but family events the past few weekends have prevented me from being able to make the 5-6 hour drive there (plus another 5-6 hours back). This past Friday I found out that some fellow coworkers of mine were on their way to Nashville for a weekend getaway, so I reached out to them to ask them a huge favor, to do some hunting for me while they were there. I sent them a screen shot of the two new Tasters’ bottles, and asked them to see if they could find them while they were there. Lucky for me they did! A big shout out to K-n-K for picking them up for me. Here are the photos of the High Angel’s Share Barrel bottle. Release: October 2018Proof: 107Size: 375mlPrice: $49 "

    "title": "Gentleman Jack Limited Edition Time Piece Bottle",
    "body": "2019/06/18 - One of the things I want to do here on this blog is document the various Jack Daniel’s collectables, primarily bottles, that I’ve managed to acquire over time. This is the first post in that series. In 2017, Jack Daniel’s announced/released a new bottle in the Gentleman Jack product line, called The Limited Edition Gentleman Jack, often referred to as the Time Piece. The bottle markings on the packaging of the bottle are reminiscent of the pocket watch that Jack Daniel carried around. I had trouble trying to locate the bottle here in St. Louis, checking all the local liquor stores, along with the big box Total Wine locations. In March of 2018 I was driving to Georgia for an autocross event with a buddy of mine, and stopped to buy a car in Murfreesboro Tennessee. While at the dealer, I asked my sales guy where I could find a decent liquor store, so that I could try to find the Time Piece. He sent me a few streets over, and I found a bottle of Tennessee Rye which I hadn’t seen before, but no Time Piece to be found. It was getting late in the day, and I was hoping to try to swing by the Distillery (my buddy who drove me to Murfreesboro had headed down there while I was doing paperwork on the car), but I wasn’t sure if I could make it down before the White Rabbit bottle shop closed. I decided I would try another liquor store on the way over to Lynchburg. At this store I asked the guys behind the counter if they had a Time Piece bottle. One guy said yes he did, but it was in his private collection, and not for sale. I looked around the store, picked up something there (can’t recall which bottle) and then checked out. While checking out he mentioned that there was a place near Shelbyville, called Celebration Liquors that might have the bottle. It was on my way to Lynchburg, so I decided I was for sure stopping when I got there. Upon arrival I looked around the store, but couldn’t find the bottle. I asked the girl behind the counter if she knew anything about the bottle, but she didn’t know what it was. If I recall correctly, she did however offer to call the owner, and he told her the bottle was right behind her. We both had missed it sitting there on a shelf behind the counter. Score! I was able to purchase one bottle of the Gentleman Jack Limited Edition bottle, seen above on this post. What this hunt made me realize though, was that I wasn’t the only one out there collecting Jack Daniel’s gear. I realized that people collected, and even collected extras, so that they could “trade” for other items to add to their collections. A few short weeks ago, I stopped by Total Wine on my way home from work one day, something I occasionally do just to see if they have anything JD related in stock that I don’t have. This time, they did, they had Time Piece bottles, and multiple! I picked one up, and walked to the register, paying about 50% of what I paid for the bottle in Shelbyville. By the time I got home I started kicking myself for not buying a few, when I stopped by that Total Wine again they were completely out. I ended up checking another TW location the next weekend and picked up 3 more bottles so that I could start creating a stock of items that I could trade in the future! If you’re looking for a Gentleman Jack Limited Edition Time Piece bottle, check out my Hunt List to see if you have something I need, maybe we can trade!

    "body": "2018/11/18 - My name is Chris Hammond, I started my journey with Jack Daniel’s at a young age. My father would have a Jack and Coke, every night after work. One and done, but as well as I can remember, it was a nightly ritual. I might have snuck a taste as a kid, but I wasn’t a kid who drank in high school, it wasn’t until college until I really had my first drink. I was in a fraternity at a small engineering school in Missouri, it was in a small town, with a very skewed guy to girl ratio, so even though joining a fraternity had never crossed my mind prior to college, it made sense to me and built me into who I am today. While you might think there is a lot of drinking in a fraternity in college, it isn’t required, and it was never forced upon me. So when I did sit down to have my first drink, it was to a great surprise to my fraternity brothers. I can still remember the room, there was a group of guys that were partaking in a 1/5th (750ml) of Old No. 7, I sat down one evening and asked for my own glass, they were floored. I didn’t plan to start drinking Jack Daniel’s that evening, but I ended up doing so, and thus setting my journey into the world of Tennessee Whiskey. While I don’t have the first bottle of Jack Daniel’s I purchased, I do have a couple of bottles that I purchased during my college years. I wish I could go back in time and buy two or three, at the time I didn’t buy to collect, so the bottles from back then are all empty, but they are still mine. Why CollectorOfJack. com? I’ve been collecting Jack Daniel’s bottles for many years now, and while I am proud of my collection, there are definitely some gaps that I would like to fill. I’ve managed to acquire some extras over the years, and I’m hopeful that with this blog I’ll be able to find other like minded folks, who perhaps have bottles to fill my gaps and possibly need some of the extras that I have in my collection. So, grab a glass of Old No. 7, maybe some ice if that suits you, and take a look around here as I document all things Jack Daniel’s! "
