This site is where I document my collection, but I am always looking to grow that collection. This page is intended to be a list of Jack Daniel's bottles and memorabilia that I am searching for as well as things I might have available for trades.

This is not an all inclusive list, I am definitely looking for more than this, so if you've got something you're interested in parting with, let me know. 

### Will you sell any bottles?
I am not super interested in selling the items I have for trade, the goal is to acquire more for my collection, not decrease the size of my collection with selling at this time.

### Where will you trade?
I prefer trades in the Mid-West. I am near St. Louis, and willing to drive/meet typically within a 5 hour driving radius if needed, but don't hesitate to reach out. I travel for work some times and might be able to meet you elsewhere.
