    <title>2024 High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When hobbies collide my world is at peak. I love taking photos, motorsports, and I love collecting whiskey. A good friend of mine from my auto racing hobby got into Monster Trucks a number of years ago. I’ve had the pleasure of seeing his monster truck crush cars at the BIGFOOT Open House a few times now and this year they released a bottle of whiskey featuring Jeff’s truck, High Roller II. I won’t get into all the details about the truck itself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/HighRollerMonsterTruck&quot;&gt;you can follow them on social media for more about that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the press release about the High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Antheum Spirits and Tennessee Legend Distillery are excited to unveil High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey, a spirit that pays homage to the storied High Roller Monster Truck, which has been a symbol of adventure and resilience since 1985. As we introduce this exceptional bourbon, we celebrate the truck’s rich legacy and the dedication of its current custodian, Jeff Krekeler.
​
Dive into the world of artisanal whiskey and monster truck heritage at our launch events. Join us at Tennessee Legend’s stores in Sevierville on March 22-23, and in Nashville on March 24, for days filled with tradition, excitement, and exceptional whiskey tasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;​Jeff Krekeler, a passionate Monster Truck enthusiast from Farmington, Missouri, acquired High Roller with the vision of paying tribute to its monumental history. With the invaluable help of Rodman Hobbs, Robert Maize and an extensive team of dedicated friends and volunteers, High Roller was restored, reigniting its legacy for a new generation.
​
High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey, meticulously crafted and aged, reflects the essence of its namesake’s journey. It offers a robust palette of caramel, butterscotch, smoke, and leather, culminating in a bold 100-proof finish that honors the monster truck’s indomitable spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Our High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey is a salute to a cultural icon that has inspired awe across generations,” said Paul Francis, Co-Founder of Antheum Spirits. “It embodies a story of innovation and tenacity, and we’re excited to share this legacy through our whiskey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottle is pretty simple with a label on the front and a label on the rear, nothing on the sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-front-of-the-bottle-reads&quot;&gt;The front of the bottle reads:&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>2024 Jack Daniel&apos;s X McLaren release</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;/JackDanielsMcLaren&quot;&gt;2023 F1 Season&lt;/a&gt; Jack Daniel’s joined McLaren as a sponsor of their F1 program. For 2024 that relationship continues and with that we have a 2024 bottle! (2025 Jack Daniel’s x McLaren labels have recently popped up online as well)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the information that was provided for marketing material last year related to the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-limited-edition-collectible&quot;&gt;A Limited Edition Collectible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate this partnership, a limited edition bottle of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has been released. This collectible bottle not only celebrates the collaboration but also honors the pioneering founders of each brand, Mr. Jack Daniel and Bruce McLaren. The bottle features the distinctive papaya colorway of McLaren, along with a customized label and packaging, making it a must-have for enthusiasts of both whiskey and motorsports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-toast-to-future-success&quot;&gt;A Toast to Future Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a broader multi-year sponsorship agreement, this partnership aligns Jack Daniel’s—one of the world’s best-selling whiskeys—with the high-performance and international prestige of the McLaren Formula 1 team. Fans of motorsports and whiskey alike can look forward to a variety of events, media, and hospitality programs throughout the 2023 F1 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bottle-information&quot;&gt;Bottle Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from our photo gallery here the bottle and box have been updated from the 2023 version with more striking orange stripes dominating both the bottle and box. Here are some additional details about the bottle and box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-front-of-the-box-reads&quot;&gt;The front of the box reads:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As Jack always said: “Every day we&lt;br /&gt;
make it, we’ll make it the best we can.”&lt;br /&gt;
And that is as true today as it was&lt;br /&gt;
back then.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Jack always said: “Every day we make it,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bottles, unlike the 2023 release, appear to have been released to a much wider set of retailers. COJ was able to find it here in Missouri where they definitely were not sold in MO in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release:&lt;/strong&gt; 2024&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; 80&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1L&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $45&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-is-jack-daniels--mclaren-racing-formula-1-worth&quot;&gt;How Much Is Jack Daniel’s / McLaren Racing Formula 1 Worth?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can find it in one of the states that it is sold, definitely don’t pay more than retail. If you’re shopping elsewhere be prepared to pay a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the packaging for these bottles is special, the juice is regular Jack Daniel’s. Get it if under $50&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Family ties to bootlegging during prohibition</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;As we get older, we get more nostalgic. As both my parents have aged, my brother and I have spent time going through things they have kept/collected throughout the years. In doing so, you come across all sorts of interesting things, I feel like the older you get, the more interesting some of those things become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I came across a few years ago, and flagged for future research, was a newspaper clipping. Actually it was more than a clipping, it was the entire front page of the May 13th, 1924 Sedalia Capital. The headline at the top of the newspaper read&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AGENTS FIND BIG STILL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this and wondered why would my father have this paper, it was from 21 years before his birth. The 1920s were deep in the prohibition era, and if you spend any time researching that time period you’ll find almost daily mentions in the papers about violations of prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being that this article was published 100 years ago today, I figured it was a good time to put a blog post together about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Dad passed last year, I spent some time in Sedalia for his funeral and also for my uncle and great aunt’s funerals. In doing so, I was able to spend some time walking around a couple of cemeteries and looking at the various names. One of those names was Butterbaugh. The article mentions the Still was found in a raid of the E. H. Butterbaugh farm, north of Sedalia. The Hammond and Butterbaugh families have a lot of space consumed at the Hopewell Cemetary north of Sedalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent some time over the past couple of years dabling with ancestry.com, trying to see how far the family tree stretches, earlier this year I went down the rabbit hole of tracking down who E. H. Butterbaugh was, and how we are connected. Before I get into the family specifics, let’s take a look at a couple of the articles I’ve been able to dig up relating to this corn whiskey still. Besides the Sedalia Democrat front page, I was able to use NewspaperArchives.com to track down a number of reports and details about the raid with a variety of articles that reported on it through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the text of the article from the Sedalia Democrat from May 13, 1924 (image of article transcribed by ChatGPT, I’ve tried to ensure correctness but it’s possible it missed some words, original paper clipping attached to the gallery)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;immense-still-seized-in-raid-late-monday&quot;&gt;IMMENSE STILL SEIZED IN RAID LATE MONDAY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Found Concealed Beneath Barn on Farm of E. W. Butterbaugh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is declared to be the largest still ever sized in Pettis county was found late Monday afternoon by Sheriff W. H. Fewell, Deputy Sheriff Landon Welch and two federal officers working under Chief General Prohibition Agent W. D. Moss, of Kansas City. In an underground room on the farm of E. W. Butterbaugh, eight miles northeast of Sedalia. The officers were acting under a search warrant issued by United States Commissioner W. E. Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Butterbaugh was taken in custody, brought to Sedalia and appeared before Commissioner Miller, where he furnished bond of $1000 signed by J. W. Roach, for his appearance at a preliminary hearing before Commissioner Miller, at 2 o’clock Saturday afternoon, May 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So carefully concealed was the still that although the officers had received tips, stating that it was underneath the barn, they searched the place for two hours before they finally came upon a trap door under the manger, covered with hay, which led down steps into a concealed room, where the fifty gallon capacity copper still was found. He was brought to the county jail by the officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This room, the officers stated, was 12 by 15 feet, well ventilated, and lighted by a lamp. The farm had been searched about a half dozen times before, but although the officers had received their information very straight, they were unable to locate the hiding place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nearly 300 gallons of mash was found, but no corn whisky. The officers did find about a gallon and a half of corn whisky in jugs across the road from the Butterbaugh place, but were unable to find to whom it belonged, or by whom it had been placed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to the officers, they tapped the telephone wire leading into the home, and overheard a conversation in which some one “tipped” Butterbaugh to the fact that the raid was going to be made. “This is Fred” the voice is said to have informed Mrs. Butterbaugh, and told her to get her husband, and get him quick. Later, the officers stated, a car left the Butterbaugh place, going south, and returned in about twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Butterbaugh later admitted to the officers that he had removed the coil from the still, and had thrown it into the creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The officers also arrested three negroes, during the afternoon, Melvin Jones, charged with selling four and one half pints of corn whisky for $1 per half pint; Oscar Bell, charged with possessing and selling corn whisky, and Babe Bell, also charged with possessing and selling whisky. All were released on bond and bound over to the action of the federal court, which convenes in Jefferson City in October. The bonds of Oscar and Babe Bell, for $500 each were signed by their mother, Mary Preston, while Jones’ bond was signed by his brother-in-law, A. T. Jackman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The federal officers stated this afternoon that they had been given splendid support in their work in Pettis County by Sheriff W. H. Fewell and his deputies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How am I connected to E. W. Butterbaugh? Well, through a lot of digging and family tree research I have determined that Edward William Butterbaugh was the step grandson of my 3rd Great Aunt on my father’s side. Kicker, he’s also the Stepson of my 1st Cousin 4x removed….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heres-a-more-detailed-breakdown&quot;&gt;Here’s a more detailed breakdown.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 4th Great Grandfather on my Dad’s side was Anson Hammond (1821-1864). Anson was married to Margaretta A. Witty Hammond (1825-1891), they had 8 children. My 3rd Great Grandfather was their second eldest, Barzillia Hammond. Their youngest Daughter was Susan E. Hammond (1858-1939). Susan E. Hammond originally married Benjamin Ditton in 1874, they had I believe two children Wilbur and Ruth Ditton.  (In finalizing this article I came across a third child, listed below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Benjamin Ditton passed and Susan remarried in August 1890 to David Butterbaugh. David and Susan had 2 children between them, Margaret Jane “Maggie” Butterbaugh (1891-1969) and Golda “Goldie” Hazel Butterbaugh (1893-1981). David had 7 children prior to marrying Susan. One of those children was William B. Butterbaugh (1864-1952), Edward W. Butterbaugh’s (1891-1965) father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E. W.’s mother was Elizabeth Edwards (1876-1891). Now here’s the twist. E.W.’s father William, after Elizabeth’s passing, married Edith M Belle Ditton (1876-1911), who I believe to be Susan E. Hammond and Benjamin Ditton’s daughter. So, E.W.’s grandfather was married to his step mom’s mother (step grandmother).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;butterbaugh-prohibition-issues&quot;&gt;Butterbaugh Prohibition Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing research for this article, I came across multiple short blurbs in newspapers about the Butterbaugh family having run ins with the law during prohibition. I wish I had a connection to a recipe or something from back then, would be cool to start a Butterbaugh Whiskey business based on family history! I’ve included a number of different incidents and paper mentions in the gallery here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hammond-family-history&quot;&gt;Hammond Family History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for another Hammond family history post next month as I get into the topic of Mattie Corrine Hammond! I’ll post that over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.horsesandcars.com&quot;&gt;HorsesAndCars.com&lt;/a&gt; as it doesn’t have a whiskey tie into it (that I’ve found).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.horsesandcars.com/hammond-family-history-1800s&quot;&gt;Here’s another Hammond Family history article that is actually a transcription from something that Susan E. Hammond wrote before she passed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Woodford Reserve&apos;s Kentucky Derby 150th Kentucky Bourbon</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Woodford Reserve’s Kentucky Derby series of bottles is a special annual release that celebrates one of America’s most storied horse races, the Kentucky Derby. Each year, Woodford Reserve, a major sponsor of the Derby, issues a limited-edition bottle featuring artwork that pays tribute to the famous race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This year’s special release features the artwork of Kentucky native Wylie Caudill, known for his bold, repetitive patterns, and his signature roses. His painting, “Adorned in Roses,” depicts a racing thoroughbred covered with red roses, with a background of multi-colored roses. - WoodfordReserve.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some key points about this series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Tradition:&lt;/strong&gt; The tradition started in 1999, and each year a new bottle design is released to commemorate the Kentucky Derby, which is held annually on the first Saturday in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artistic Bottles:&lt;/strong&gt; The bottles are notable for their collectible artwork that varies each year. The art typically captures the spirit and excitement of the Kentucky Derby, featuring scenes from the race, the spectators, and the Churchill Downs racetrack where the event is held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artists:&lt;/strong&gt; The artwork on the bottles is often created by different artists, making each year’s release unique. These artists include painters and illustrators known for their distinct styles, contributing to the bottles’ appeal as collectibles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Edition Whiskey:&lt;/strong&gt; The whiskey inside the bottles is Woodford Reserve’s premium Kentucky Straight Bourbon. Occasionally, the brand might vary the whiskey type, but typically it features their classic bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch Events and Signings:&lt;/strong&gt; To mark the release of the Derby bottles, Woodford Reserve often organizes events, which can include bottle signings with the artists and tasting events at various venues, including Churchill Downs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charitable Aspect:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes, Woodford Reserve ties the release of these bottles to charitable causes, raising funds for organizations related to the horse racing community and other local initiatives.
Collectors of bourbon and horse racing enthusiasts often look forward to the release of these bottles each year, both for their aesthetic appeal and for their significance as a celebration of one of the most iconic sports events in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release:&lt;/strong&gt; 2024&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; 90.4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1L&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $59&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-is-woodford-reserves-kentucky-derby-150th-kentucky-bourbon-worth&quot;&gt;How Much Is Woodford Reserve’s Kentucky Derby 150th Kentucky Bourbon Worth?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottle may hold some value to Kentucky Derby fans, but due to the large distribution of these across the country the value is right around retail, or even below. I paid $60 for it and can find it online for $45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collector-of-jacks-value-assessment&quot;&gt;Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you collect the Kentucky Derby bottles, definitely pick one up to add to your collection. This being the 150th may also add some value in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Daniel&apos;s Twice Barreled Heritage Barrel Rye</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Special Release from Jack Daniel’s brings us another heritage barrel selection, and another twice barreled offering (&lt;a href=&quot;/TwiceBarreledAmericanMalt&quot;&gt;like 2022&lt;/a&gt;) at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s edition is a Rye, first barreled in new oak barrels, then followed up with a second maturing session in some extra toasty heritage barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 700ml bottles are bottled at 100 proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A SPECIAL TWIST ON OUR ORIGINAL HERITAGE BARREL EXPRESSION
The Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Special Release series highlights an annual limited innovation from the Jack Daniel Distillery and this year’s release is a twist on the original – Heritage Barrel. Twice Barreled Heritage Barrel Rye is a celebration of the whiskey-making traditions of our distillery and the barrel-making expertise of our cooperage. The 2023 Jack Daniel’s Special Release is a one-of-a-kind experience crafted from 70% rye, 18% corn, and 12% malted barley and twice barreled for a complex taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the heritage bottles lately, the labels are primarly screen printed on the bottle, with some paper label at the bottom on the front, and the rear (actually side) label is also paper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Daniel&apos;s Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jack Daniel’s ventured into Rye over 10 years ago and has regularly been adding to their line since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023 Jack Daniel’s started bottling and releasing their Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye, to go along with their Single Barrel Barrel Proof Tennessee Whiskey. This will be regular release going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the initial release it has been difficult to find on the shelves, but in the past couple of years, Single Barrel Barrel Proof Tennesse Whiskey has been hard to come by as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barrel is the typical Jack Daniel’s single barrel bottle, with the gold label that you should be familiar with. The print on the labels are in green, versus the usual black for the normal barrel proof. The neck contains a green label with the barrel number, bottling date, and the knob on the cork is the usual black with the Jack Daniel’s logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom label on the front reads RYE and has a green background where the proof and volume are listed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I paid retail for my first bottle, but I didn’t. I found this bottle in Nashville, TN in June 2023. I paid about 2x retail, but it was the first one I had found, and was a very high proof at 139.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you found a bottle of the Barrel Proof Rye yet? Keep looking, it should be available pretty much anywhere you can find the Barrel Proof Tennessee Whiskey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two previous Barrel Proof Ryes released by Jack Daniel’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/TennesseeTastersBarrelProofRye&quot;&gt;Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Tasters’ Barrel Proof Rye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2020SpecialRelease&quot;&gt;2020 Jack Daniel’s Barrel Proof Rye Special Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release:&lt;/strong&gt; 2023&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; 139.3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 750ml&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $65&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-is-jack-daniels-single-barrel-barrel-proof-rye-worth&quot;&gt;How Much Is Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye Worth?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye is worth retail price. You shouldn’t really be paying more than retail for this bottle as it is a regular release. Higher proofs might draw a little more value, but not too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collector-of-jacks-value-assessment&quot;&gt;Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great bottle to own, go for the higher proofs you can find, or bottls with specific bottling dates that are important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Daniel&apos;s and McLaren Racing: A Toast to High-Speed Partnership</title>
    <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;celebrating-five-years-of-collectorofjackcom&quot;&gt;Celebrating Five Years of CollectorOfJack.com&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, November 18, 2023, marks a special milestone for us at CollectorOfJack.com. It’s been exactly five years since we launched our website in its first iteration back on November 18, 2018. We’ve come a long way since then, and we’re excited to continue sharing our passion for Jack Daniel’s with you. While posts have been infrequent lately, our founder Chris Hammond is committed to ramping up the content. Expect to see more frequent updates, with the aim of bringing you new and exciting content at least once a week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-blend-of-heritage-and-high-performance&quot;&gt;A Blend of Heritage and High Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight (tomorrow morning really) is the Formula 1 race in Las Vegas, today’s post is in honor of that hopefully great event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lynchburg, Tennessee&lt;/strong&gt; – In a groundbreaking move, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and McLaren Racing have announced a multi-year partnership, starting in 2023. This collaboration marks the first venture of Jack Daniel’s, a brand steeped in over 155 years of whiskey crafting heritage, into the high-octane world of Formula 1 racing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img src=”/images/generated/67/f1car-800-e9a435bea.jpg” alt=”“Jack Daniel’s / McLaren F1 Car”” srcset=”/images/generated/67/f1car-200-e9a435bea.jpg 200w, /images/generated/67/f1car-400-e9a435bea.jpg 400w, /images/generated/67/f1car-800-e9a435bea.jpg 800w, /images/generated/67/f1car-1600-e9a435bea.jpg 1600w, /images/generated/67/f1car-2000-e9a435bea.jpg 2000w”&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-look-on-the-track&quot;&gt;A New Look on the Track&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Daniel’s iconic branding will be prominently displayed on the nose of McLaren’s 2023 Formula 1 cars. Additionally, the brand’s logos will adorn the drivers’ overalls and the helmets of the pit crew, integrating the whiskey brand’s identity into the dynamic and globally followed sport of Formula 1 racing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-limited-edition-collectible&quot;&gt;A Limited Edition Collectible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate this partnership, a limited edition bottle of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has been released. This collectible bottle not only celebrates the collaboration but also honors the pioneering founders of each brand, Mr. Jack Daniel and Bruce McLaren. The bottle features the distinctive papaya colorway of McLaren, along with a customized label and packaging, making it a must-have for enthusiasts of both whiskey and motorsports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-toast-to-future-success&quot;&gt;A Toast to Future Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a broader multi-year sponsorship agreement, this partnership aligns Jack Daniel’s—one of the world’s best-selling whiskeys—with the high-performance and international prestige of the McLaren Formula 1 team. Fans of motorsports and whiskey alike can look forward to a variety of events, media, and hospitality programs throughout the 2023 F1 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bottle-information&quot;&gt;Bottle Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from our photo gallery here the bottle and box are quite the departure from anything we’ve seen from Jack Daniel’s in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Daniel&apos;s Twice Barreled American Single Malt 2022 Special Release</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve blogged about a real bottle, that doesn’t mean I haven’t been collecting. I simply got it in my head that I needed the perfect backdrop for my photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have the 2022 Special Release from Jack Daniels: Jack Daniels 2022 Special Release Twice Barreled American Single Malt. This is a Single Malt, I believe a first from Jack Daniel’s. It was then aged in Oloroso Sherry barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front of the bottle reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Neck Label: 2022 Special Release&lt;br /&gt;
Label: Uniquely Crafted Handmade Barrels&lt;br /&gt;
Twice Barreled Special Release American Single Malt&lt;br /&gt;
American Single Malt Whiskey Oloroso Sherry Cask Finished&lt;br /&gt;
Crafted from 100% malted barley twice barreled for a complex taste &amp;amp; bottled straight from the finest Oloroso sherry casks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The side labels read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Limited Bottle No. ASM-29592&lt;br /&gt;
This special release series highlights the Jack Daniel Distillery’s Innovation. Crafted from 100% malted barley, matured first in new American charred oak barrels and then in the finest Oloroso Sherry casks, we extend this one-of-a-kind craftsmanship to you.&lt;br /&gt;
Processed using minimum filtration to sustain its unique flavor profile. Sediment may occur over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-oloroso-sherry&quot;&gt;What is Oloroso Sherry?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oloroso Sherry Cask are whisky casks which have been previously held Oloroso Sherry. Oloroso Sherry is a type of fortified wine produced near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. The Sherry Triangle produces wines which have been ‘fortified’ with a higher alcohol strength in order to prevent yeast growth and bottled under the official name of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry. There is something of a manufactured misconception, that the casks used at these bodegas are the same used for whisky maturation however this is not the case. Oloroso sherry casks are more commonly known as sherry butts within the whisky industry. - WhiskeyPedia https://whiskipedia.com/fundamentals/oloroso-sherry-casks/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-november-2023&quot;&gt;Update November 2023:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite bottles of Jack Daniel’s. I ended up opening it with some buddies earlier this year and the flavor is just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can get one, I highly recommend it. For a while they were going 250-300 on secondary, but I believe they dropped a bit since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release:&lt;/strong&gt; 2022&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; 106.6&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $79&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-much-is-jack-daniels-twice-barreled-heritage-barrel-rye-worth&quot;&gt;How Much Is Jack Daniel’s Twice Barreled Heritage Barrel Rye Worth?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary for this bottle started out really high, north of $250, but fell towards the end of 2022, with it being found for around $200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collector-of-jacks-value-assessment&quot;&gt;Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t spend more then $225 for a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Daniel&apos;s life story, according to ChatGPT</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I’ve been playing with ChatGPT. I figured I should give it a shot at writing the life story of Jack Daniel’s. I’m not sure if it’s 100% accurate, but it certainly hits most of the points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prompt&quot;&gt;Prompt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the life story of Jack Daniel? Be sure to include information Nearest Green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;response&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Daniel was an American distiller and businessman who founded the Jack Daniel’s Tennessee whiskey distillery. His life story is one of perseverance, ingenuity, and hard work, and it is also deeply connected to the story of Nearest Green, an African American distiller who played a significant role in the development of the Jack Daniel’s brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Daniel was born in 1850 in Lynchburg, Tennessee. His exact birthdate is unknown as birth records were not kept in his area at the time. He was the youngest of ten children, and his parents were of Scottish and Irish descent. His father died when he was young, and he grew up working on his family’s farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he was 13, Jack ran away from home and was taken in by a local preacher, Dan Call. Call owned a distillery and taught Jack the art of making whiskey. After a few years, Jack left to start his own distillery with his mentor’s help. They called their operation “Call and Daniel’s,” and it quickly became successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1884, Jack bought out his partner and renamed the distillery “Jack Daniel’s.” He perfected his recipe for Tennessee whiskey, using a unique charcoal mellowing process that gave the whiskey a smoother flavor. His whiskey became famous, and he won numerous awards for its quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for many years, the role that Nearest Green played in the development of the Jack Daniel’s brand was largely unknown. Green was a slave on a farm owned by Dan Call, and he was also a skilled distiller. It is believed that Green taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey using the charcoal mellowing process, which became a defining characteristic of the Jack Daniel’s brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Civil War, Green continued to work for Call as a free man and was eventually hired by Jack Daniel as the distillery’s first head distiller. Green taught his techniques to other workers at the distillery, and his legacy lived on long after his death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, many people see Green as an important figure in the history of American whiskey and an example of the resilience and ingenuity of the African American community. In recent years, the Jack Daniel’s distillery has taken steps to honor Green’s legacy, including unveiling a memorial to him in 2016 and establishing the Nearest Green Foundation to promote diversity in the whiskey industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Daniel’s whiskey remains one of the most popular whiskey brands in the world, with its distinctive black and white label recognized across the globe. The distillery still operates in Lynchburg, Tennessee, and attracts visitors from around the world who want to learn more about the history of this iconic brand and the important role that Nearest Green played in its development.&lt;/p&gt;
