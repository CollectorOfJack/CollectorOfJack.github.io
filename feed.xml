    <title>Jack Daniel&apos;s Winter Jack 2024 - Spiced Apple Punch</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;It appears that the Winter Jack release for 2024 has a new label! This is what I believe to the the third iteration of the label/product since it’s initial release in 2013. &lt;a href=&quot;/WinterJack2013&quot;&gt;First Release&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/WinterJack&quot;&gt;Second Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s different? Where it previously said “Tennessee Cider” the label now reads “Tennessee Spiced Apple Punch”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-i-get-a-bottle&quot;&gt;How did I get a bottle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this bottle at Dogwood Wine and Spirits in Ellisville, MO back in September. It was mixed in with a number of the older label bottles still available on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;front-label&quot;&gt;Front Label&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A seasonal blend of apple cider liqueur &amp;amp; Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bottle has the same label as that of the last release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;side-label&quot;&gt;Side Label&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side of the bottle reads the same as the previous release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jack Daniel’s Winter Jack is a seasonal blend made perfect with our apple cider liqueur, Jack Daniel’s Old No.7 Tennessee Whiskey. An original recipe from Jack’s home, Lynchburg Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rear-label&quot;&gt;Rear Label&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rear of the bottle is slightly different from the previous release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jack Daniel’s Winter Jack Spiced Apple Punch 
“Best Served Warm” &lt;br /&gt;
There is something special about every season in Lynchburg. Even the cold of winter has its own charm. We like to spend it gathered with family and friends, sharing a warm Tennessee Spiced Apple Punch crafted from an original family recipe. Now, we are proud to share this tradition with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;side-label-1&quot;&gt;Side Label&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the bottle reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Made with original Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 &lt;br /&gt;
Best served warm when it’s cold 
Share with friends and family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release:&lt;/strong&gt; 2024&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; 30&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 750ml&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $24&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-is-jack-daniels-winter-jack-tennessee-spiced-apple-punch&quot;&gt;How Much Is Jack Daniel’s Winter Jack Tennessee Spiced Apple Punch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally priced around $24, you should still find it on shelves everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collector-of-jacks-value-assessment&quot;&gt;Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick one up for your collection, and one to drink! Short term value on these is retail, long term value is TBD, but not likely very high.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Daniel&apos;s Distillery Series 009 Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey Finished In High Toast Oak Barrels</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Also released in July 2022, this second rye released in the Distillery Series, the Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey Finished In High Toast Oak Barrels, part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/series/tasters-distillery&quot;&gt;Jack Daniel’s Distillery Series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release 009 is another release of a Rye Whiskey from Jack Daniel’s this time finished in a high toast oak barrel, in addition to the usual charred oak barrel that most of Jack Daniels whiskeys are aged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-i-get-a-bottle&quot;&gt;How did I get a bottle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the 008 release, I picked this bottle up after a hockey tournament in Louisville Kentucky. After we finished up the tournament my son and I drove south to Tennessee. I was fortunate enough to come across a store who had bottles of releases 008, 009 and 010 that I picked up for retail! I stopped at 3 or 4 more stores on the way around Nashville back to Highway 24 and didn’t find any more along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Daniel&apos;s Distillery Series 008 Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey Finished In High Toast Maple Barrels</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;With the July 2022 release of the Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey Finished In High Toast Maple Barrels Jack Daniel’s has changed from the Tennessee Tasters Series to the &lt;a href=&quot;/series/tasters-distillery&quot;&gt;Jack Daniel’s Distillery Series&lt;/a&gt;. With the series change comes a few additional things that change with the releases going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While still released in a 375ml bottle, the new Distillery Series bottles are slightly bigger than the old Tennessee Tasters Series bottles. The labels on the bottles have changed as well, now wrapping around the right side of the bottles as the bottom label does on both series now. The label is a little more formal now, a little more official, a little less “just for the tasters feel”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release 008 is another release of a Rye Whiskey from Jack Daniel’s this time finished in a maple barrel, if you’ve tried any of Jack Daniel’s Distillery’s other Maple releases you know you will want to try this out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-i-get-a-bottle&quot;&gt;How did I get a bottle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spring of 2023 my son had a hockey tournament in Louisville Kentucky. After we finished up the tournament I decided we would take a drive down to Tennessee on the way home back to St. Louis. Not exactly on the way, but I was fortunate enough to come across a store who had bottles of releases 008, 009 and 010 that I picked up for retail! I stopped at 3 or 4 more stores on the way around Nashville back to Highway 24 and didn’t find any more along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2024 High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When hobbies collide my world is at peak. I love taking photos, motorsports, and I love collecting whiskey. A good friend of mine from my auto racing hobby got into Monster Trucks a number of years ago. I’ve had the pleasure of seeing his monster truck crush cars at the BIGFOOT Open House a few times now and this year they released a bottle of whiskey featuring Jeff’s truck, High Roller II. I won’t get into all the details about the truck itself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/HighRollerMonsterTruck&quot;&gt;you can follow them on social media for more about that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the press release about the High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Antheum Spirits and Tennessee Legend Distillery are excited to unveil High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey, a spirit that pays homage to the storied High Roller Monster Truck, which has been a symbol of adventure and resilience since 1985. As we introduce this exceptional bourbon, we celebrate the truck’s rich legacy and the dedication of its current custodian, Jeff Krekeler.
​
Dive into the world of artisanal whiskey and monster truck heritage at our launch events. Join us at Tennessee Legend’s stores in Sevierville on March 22-23, and in Nashville on March 24, for days filled with tradition, excitement, and exceptional whiskey tasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;​Jeff Krekeler, a passionate Monster Truck enthusiast from Farmington, Missouri, acquired High Roller with the vision of paying tribute to its monumental history. With the invaluable help of Rodman Hobbs, Robert Maize and an extensive team of dedicated friends and volunteers, High Roller was restored, reigniting its legacy for a new generation.
​
High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey, meticulously crafted and aged, reflects the essence of its namesake’s journey. It offers a robust palette of caramel, butterscotch, smoke, and leather, culminating in a bold 100-proof finish that honors the monster truck’s indomitable spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Our High Roller Straight Bourbon Whiskey is a salute to a cultural icon that has inspired awe across generations,” said Paul Francis, Co-Founder of Antheum Spirits. “It embodies a story of innovation and tenacity, and we’re excited to share this legacy through our whiskey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottle is pretty simple with a label on the front and a label on the rear, nothing on the sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-front-of-the-bottle-reads&quot;&gt;The front of the bottle reads:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    <title>2024 Jack Daniel&apos;s X McLaren release</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;/JackDanielsMcLaren&quot;&gt;2023 F1 Season&lt;/a&gt; Jack Daniel’s joined McLaren as a sponsor of their F1 program. For 2024 that relationship continues and with that we have a 2024 bottle! (2025 Jack Daniel’s x McLaren labels have recently popped up online as well)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the information that was provided for marketing material last year related to the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-limited-edition-collectible&quot;&gt;A Limited Edition Collectible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate this partnership, a limited edition bottle of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has been released. This collectible bottle not only celebrates the collaboration but also honors the pioneering founders of each brand, Mr. Jack Daniel and Bruce McLaren. The bottle features the distinctive papaya colorway of McLaren, along with a customized label and packaging, making it a must-have for enthusiasts of both whiskey and motorsports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-toast-to-future-success&quot;&gt;A Toast to Future Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a broader multi-year sponsorship agreement, this partnership aligns Jack Daniel’s—one of the world’s best-selling whiskeys—with the high-performance and international prestige of the McLaren Formula 1 team. Fans of motorsports and whiskey alike can look forward to a variety of events, media, and hospitality programs throughout the 2023 F1 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bottle-information&quot;&gt;Bottle Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from our photo gallery here the bottle and box have been updated from the 2023 version with more striking orange stripes dominating both the bottle and box. Here are some additional details about the bottle and box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bottles, unlike the 2023 release, appear to have been released to a much wider set of retailers. COJ was able to find it here in Missouri where they definitely were not sold in MO in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release:&lt;/strong&gt; 2024&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find it in one of the states that it is sold, definitely don’t pay more than retail. If you’re shopping elsewhere be prepared to pay a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collector-of-jacks-value-assessment&quot;&gt;Collector Of Jack’s Value Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab one and hold on to it, years from now they’ll be worth a few bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Family ties to bootlegging during prohibition</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;As we get older, we get more nostalgic. As both my parents have aged, my brother and I have spent time going through things they have kept/collected throughout the years. In doing so, you come across all sorts of interesting things, I feel like the older you get, the more interesting some of those things become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I came across a few years ago, and flagged for future research, was a newspaper clipping. Actually it was more than a clipping, it was the entire front page of the May 13th, 1924 Sedalia Capital. The headline at the top of the newspaper read&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AGENTS FIND BIG STILL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this and wondered why would my father have this paper, it was from 21 years before his birth. The 1920s were deep in the prohibition era, and if you spend any time researching that time period you’ll find almost daily mentions in the papers about violations of prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being that this article was published 100 years ago today, I figured it was a good time to put a blog post together about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Dad passed last year, I spent some time in Sedalia for his funeral and also for my uncle and great aunt’s funerals. In doing so, I was able to spend some time walking around a couple of cemeteries and looking at the various names. One of those names was Butterbaugh. The article mentions the Still was found in a raid of the E. H. Butterbaugh farm, north of Sedalia. The Hammond and Butterbaugh families have a lot of space consumed at the Hopewell Cemetary north of Sedalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent some time over the past couple of years dabling with ancestry.com, trying to see how far the family tree stretches, earlier this year I went down the rabbit hole of tracking down who E. H. Butterbaugh was, and how we are connected. Before I get into the family specifics, let’s take a look at a couple of the articles I’ve been able to dig up relating to this corn whiskey still. Besides the Sedalia Democrat front page, I was able to use NewspaperArchives.com to track down a number of reports and details about the raid with a variety of articles that reported on it through the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the text of the article from the Sedalia Democrat from May 13, 1924 (image of article transcribed by ChatGPT, I’ve tried to ensure correctness but it’s possible it missed some words, original paper clipping attached to the gallery)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;immense-still-seized-in-raid-late-monday&quot;&gt;IMMENSE STILL SEIZED IN RAID LATE MONDAY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Found Concealed Beneath Barn on Farm of E. W. Butterbaugh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is declared to be the largest still ever sized in Pettis county was found late Monday afternoon by Sheriff W. H. Fewell, Deputy Sheriff Landon Welch and two federal officers working under Chief General Prohibition Agent W. D. Moss, of Kansas City. In an underground room on the farm of E. W. Butterbaugh, eight miles northeast of Sedalia. The officers were acting under a search warrant issued by United States Commissioner W. E. Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Butterbaugh was taken in custody, brought to Sedalia and appeared before Commissioner Miller, where he furnished bond of $1000 signed by J. W. Roach, for his appearance at a preliminary hearing before Commissioner Miller, at 2 o’clock Saturday afternoon, May 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So carefully concealed was the still that although the officers had received tips, stating that it was underneath the barn, they searched the place for two hours before they finally came upon a trap door under the manger, covered with hay, which led down steps into a concealed room, where the fifty gallon capacity copper still was found. He was brought to the county jail by the officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This room, the officers stated, was 12 by 15 feet, well ventilated, and lighted by a lamp. The farm had been searched about a half dozen times before, but although the officers had received their information very straight, they were unable to locate the hiding place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nearly 300 gallons of mash was found, but no corn whisky. The officers did find about a gallon and a half of corn whisky in jugs across the road from the Butterbaugh place, but were unable to find to whom it belonged, or by whom it had been placed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to the officers, they tapped the telephone wire leading into the home, and overheard a conversation in which some one “tipped” Butterbaugh to the fact that the raid was going to be made. “This is Fred” the voice is said to have informed Mrs. Butterbaugh, and told her to get her husband, and get him quick. Later, the officers stated, a car left the Butterbaugh place, going south, and returned in about twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Butterbaugh later admitted to the officers that he had removed the coil from the still, and had thrown it into the creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The officers also arrested three negroes, during the afternoon, Melvin Jones, charged with selling four and one half pints of corn whisky for $1 per half pint; Oscar Bell, charged with possessing and selling corn whisky, and Babe Bell, also charged with possessing and selling whisky. All were released on bond and bound over to the action of the federal court, which convenes in Jefferson City in October. The bonds of Oscar and Babe Bell, for $500 each were signed by their mother, Mary Preston, while Jones’ bond was signed by his brother-in-law, A. T. Jackman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The federal officers stated this afternoon that they had been given splendid support in their work in Pettis County by Sheriff W. H. Fewell and his deputies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How am I connected to E. W. Butterbaugh? Well, through a lot of digging and family tree research I have determined that Edward William Butterbaugh was the step grandson of my 3rd Great Aunt on my father’s side. Kicker, he’s also the Stepson of my 1st Cousin 4x removed….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heres-a-more-detailed-breakdown&quot;&gt;Here’s a more detailed breakdown.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 4th Great Grandfather on my Dad’s side was Anson Hammond (1821-1864). Anson was married to Margaretta A. Witty Hammond (1825-1891), they had 8 children. My 3rd Great Grandfather was their second eldest, Barzillia Hammond. Their youngest Daughter was Susan E. Hammond (1858-1939). Susan E. Hammond originally married Benjamin Ditton in 1874, they had I believe two children Wilbur and Ruth Ditton.  (In finalizing this article I came across a third child, listed below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Benjamin Ditton passed and Susan remarried in August 1890 to David Butterbaugh. David and Susan had 2 children between them, Margaret Jane “Maggie” Butterbaugh (1891-1969) and Golda “Goldie” Hazel Butterbaugh (1893-1981). David had 7 children prior to marrying Susan. One of those children was William B. Butterbaugh (1864-1952), Edward W. Butterbaugh’s (1891-1965) father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E. W.’s mother was Elizabeth Edwards (1876-1891). Now here’s the twist. E.W.’s father William, after Elizabeth’s passing, married Edith M Belle Ditton (1876-1911), who I believe to be Susan E. Hammond and Benjamin Ditton’s daughter. So, E.W.’s grandfather was married to his step mom’s mother (step grandmother).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing research for this article, I came across multiple short blurbs in newspapers about the Butterbaugh family having run ins with the law during prohibition. I wish I had a connection to a recipe or something from back then, would be cool to start a Butterbaugh Whiskey business based on family history! I’ve included a number of different incidents and paper mentions in the gallery here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for another Hammond family history post next month as I get into the topic of Mattie Corrine Hammond! I’ll post that over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.horsesandcars.com&quot;&gt;HorsesAndCars.com&lt;/a&gt; as it doesn’t have a whiskey tie into it (that I’ve found).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.horsesandcars.com/hammond-family-history-1800s&quot;&gt;Here’s another Hammond Family history article that is actually a transcription from something that Susan E. Hammond wrote before she passed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
